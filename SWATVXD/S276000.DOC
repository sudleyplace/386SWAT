* Use the proper client register in HookPM=device,reg,fn,fn display

  Description:	The groovy code in SWATVXD that hooks a VxD's protected mode
		API entry point allows a client register to be specified by
		name.  The code that displays the register contents when the
		breakpoint is fired always displayed Client_DX.  Now we display
		the correct client register.
  When:  29 SEP 92.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Debugging a VxD's protected mode API services.
  Symptom:  The SWATMSG always shows the client DX register when stopping
	    at a HookPM= breakpoint.  For example, when stopping in the SERVER
	    VxD's protected mode API which uses AX for the functions, the
	    SWAT display always shows SERVER[17].  17 happens to be the client's
	    DX.  The correct display is SERVER[2], from the client's AX.
  Temporary Workaround:  None.
  Version:  2.76

===============================================================================

Here's what's changed and how:

SWATVER.ASM		Bumped the version number to 2.76.

SWATVXD.ASM		When picking up the client register value for the
			call to SWATMSG, get the correct offset into the
			Client_Register_Struct via PH_FNREGOFF rather than
			always specifying Client_DX.
