*  Move include files to common P:\INCLUDE directory

  Description:	The include files used to build 386MAX.VXD, SWATVXD, and QPOPUP
		have gotten out of hand.  I've moved a bunch of them into the
		P:\INCLUDE directory and changed the MAKEFILEs accordingly.
		VMAXAPI.H, VMAXAPI.INC, VMM.INC, WFW.INC, PM_BIOS.INC, and
		SWATVXD.INC have been moved.  The 386MAX.VXD, SWATVXD, and
		QPOPUP projects are affected.
		This should ease the construction of the standalone DOSMAX.386.
  When: 26 APR 93.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment:  386MAX.VXD, SWATVXD, and QPOPUP.
  Symptom:  None, it's not a bug.
  Temporary Workaround:  None, it's not a bug.
  Test Procedure:  None.
  Version:  2.82

*  Hook GetSetDetailedVMError to get more useful information on a fatal error

  Description:	A VxD will often call GetSetDetailedVMError just prior to
		issuing a fatal error.	There are about a dozen of these
		specific error codes, which can save a lot of time while trying
		to track down a fatal error.  SWATVXD now hooks the service
		during its initialization and filters calls to it.  After
		filtering out 'get' calls, NULL error codes, and one
		particularly popular default error code, it sends message text
		to 386SWAT.LOD and breaks.
  When: 26 APR 93.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment:  Windows debugging
  Symptom:  None, it's not a bug.
  Temporary Workaround:  None, it's not a bug.
  Test Procedure:  None.
  Version:  2.82

*  Allow SWATVXD to work with device= SWAT to debug Windows without 386MAX

  Description:	In order to ease the construction the standalone DOSMAX,
		SWATVXD has been modified slightly to work with device= SWAT.
		The checks for 386MAX.SYS have been relaxed, and additional
		API info is displayed in real mode.  Additional changes are
		made in 386SWAT.LOD to complete the work.
  When: 26 APR 93.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment:  Windows debugging with device= SWAT.
  Symptom:  None, it's not a bug.
  Temporary Workaround:  None, it's not a bug.
  Test Procedure:  None.
  Version:  2.82

===============================================================================

Here's what's changed and how:

\SWATVXD ...
PM_BIOS.INC		Moved into QINCLUDE.
WFW.INC 		Moved into QINCLUDE.
VMM.INC 		Moved into QINCLUDE.
SWATVXD.INC		Moved into QINCLUDE.

MAKEFILE		Reflect new locations of various include files.
			Don't build the obsolete CATSSF program.
			Add a ZIP target.

SWATVER.ASM		Bump the version # to 2.82.

SWATVXD.ASM		Add code to hook GetSetDetailedVMError and print a
			  message to the debug monitor.  Break if not a NULL
			  error code, 'nice nuke', or default error.
			Delete unused code and global variables left over
			  from old experiments.
			Many comment alignment changes.

SWAT_MSG.ASM		Reformat messages to conserve space on the mono screen.
			Add text for the 'press any key' logic.
			Add text for the XMS, IDTR, and 386MAX.SYS versions.
			Add text for the GetSetDetailedVMError code.

SWAT_RMI.ASM		Comment alignment changes.
			Remove requirement that 386MAX.SYS be installed if it
			  installed, display its version.
			Remove code to work around 386MAX's AUTO inactive state
			  it didn't work anyway.
			Add code to display XMS version.
			Add code to display real mode IDTR.
			Modify error handling to allow the same 'press any key'
			  logic as 386MAX.VXD.
