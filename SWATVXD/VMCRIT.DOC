Allow All Event Hooks

* Many more keywords are defined for all of the missing events,
  including ones new to Win95.	As this overloaded the DBG_FLAG word,
  I widened that variable to a dword and defined DB2_FLAG and DB3_FLAG
  for the next time we need to define a bit.  Some DBG_FLAG equates
  are moved to DB2_FLAG.

* Using a trick I learned while disassembling the RAM Doubler VxD, we
  can obtain the address of the start of the device chain of
  VxD_Desc_block strucs.  This allows us to HookVxD into any devices
  which may precede us, such as VMM.

* While hooking the VPD VxD under Win95, I found that VxD function 30h
  (at least when passed to VPD) doesn't conform to the expected
  register conventions upon entry to our hook handler.	To solve this,
  I used a technique similar to that already used when HookPM'ing.
  That is, the per-hook heap allocated struc now includes compiled
  code which calls a common routine.  The return address then points
  inside the hook struc whose address previously we were searching for
  (using the assumption that upon entry to our hook handler ECX points
  to the VxD's DDB which for a certain call to VPD function 30h it
  doesn't).  This same technique was then retrofitted into the HookPM
  code which used to PUSH the device ID, and jump to a common routine
  which then POPped the device ID and then searched through the list
  of hooked PM API strucs for the one is just came from.

VMM.INC 	Define equates for Win95 events.

SWATHOOK.INC	Define struc entries to hold compiled code for HookVxD
		  and HookPM.

SWATSINI.INC	Define entries for new keywords.
		Re-order others to numeric order.

SWAT_DBG.INC	Define flags for new keywords.

SWAT_MSG.ASM	Define messages for new keywords.

SWAT_SVC.ASM	Widen DBG_FLAG to dword to accommodate extra flags.

SWATSTUB.ASM	Document additional keywords.
		Align comments in same column.

SWATVXD.ASM	Define actions for new events
		Use trick to obtain start of device chain.
		Widen DBG_FLAG to dword to accommodate extra flags.
		Move some DBG_FLAG equates to DB2_FLAG.
		Check for new keywords in [386SWAT] section of
		  SYSTEM.INI
		Check for HookVxD and HookPM functions beyond the 64
		  bits we now handle (just in case).
		For HookVxD and HookPM, use compiled code in the heap
		  allocated struc to call a common routine, with the
		  return address pointing to the matching hook struc.
		Delete commented out code to map video buffer (this
		  has been handled inside SWAT for some time now).
		Check for debug breakpoint in all event handlers.
		In the common routines for HookVxD and HookPM, handle
		  the convention of the return address on the stack
		  pointing inside the matching hook struc, and don't
		  bother to search for the struc anymore.

SWATVER.ASM	Bump version #.
