Convert SWAT to USE32 Code Segment

As part of converting SWAT to a USE32 code segment, we also need to
modify SWAT VxD so it sets the D-bit for SWAT's code selector when
running under Windows.	This is done by checking the @MD_USE32 bit in
the SWAT header so SWATVXD can be used with older (USE16) versions of
SWAT.

The following modules are changed and why:

MAKEFILE	 Put .OBJ files into RET subdirectory
		 Make more directory independent.
		 Use / as separator for MASM command line arguments.

SWATSTUB.ASM	 Minor changes to copyright line.

SWATVXD.ASM	 Check @MD_USE32.

SWAT_MSG.ASM	 Minor changes to copyright line.
