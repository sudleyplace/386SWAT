Handle Multiline Message Display

Previously, the SWATDualDisplay message display dealt with one line
messages only.	Now it handles multiline messages (with embedded
CR,LFs).

Also in this TWT:

* Check for SWATSysVMInit and SWATCreateVM flags in [386SWAT] section
  of SYSTEM.INI.  These flags were defined but not enabled.


SWATSTUB.ASM	Include a few more VxD names in the default display.

SWATVXD.ASM	Move debug check for SysCriticalInit up a few
		  instructions.
		Check for SWATSysVMInit and SWATCreateVM flags.
		Delete commented out code for mono adapter mapping
		  into linear address space (SWAT use a different
		  technique now).
		In LCL_GetSetDetailedVMError, avoid overwriting
		  GSDVME_Codes data.
		In LCL_GetSetDetailedVMError, ensure message properly
		  terminated with CR,LF,0.

SWAT_MSG.ASM	Ensure all messages properly terminated with CR,LF.

SWAT_SVC.ASM	Handle embedded CR,LF in messages.
