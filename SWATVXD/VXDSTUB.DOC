Miscellaneous Changes

MAKEFILE	Remove /W2 from MASM switches as this signals many
		  silly errors.
		Omit call to MAPSYM32 as it is buggy and crashes on my
		  system.

SWATVXD.ASM	Use LC3_FLAG to test @LC3_xxx.

SWATSTUB.ASM	Document additional SYSTEM.INI [386SWAT] section
		  entries.
