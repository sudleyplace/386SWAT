* Avoid hang on fatal error exit from Windows

  Description:	The WIN386 Fatal_Error_Handler service recognizes the low bit
		of EAX as a hang-on-exit flag.	If this bit is set, the WIN386
		loader will sit in a JMP $ loop when control returns to real
		mode.  Until this was understood, there was a lot of extra
		rebooting.  This change ensures the EF_Hang_On_Exit flag is
		clear when the SWATVXD transfers control from its local
		Fatal_Error_Handler service to the original in WIN386.
  When:  28 SEP 92.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Windows debugging
  Symptom:  The DOS prompt never comes back after a Windows fatal error exit.
  Temporary Workaround:  Ctrl+Alt+Pad5 into SWAT, Ctrl+Down to skip the
			 infinite loop, and hit ESC to continue.
  Version:  2.75
