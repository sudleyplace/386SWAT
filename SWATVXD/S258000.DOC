This TWT is an attempt to get 6 months of SWATVXD changes up on the network
before embarking on the development of a major feature.

Here's what's changed and how:

MAKEFILE	The standard LSTMAC thing is added.

SWATSTUB.ASM	The standard Qualitas copyright boiler plate is added.
		The greeting message includes a copyright.
		The /? option has been added to display a list of VxD names,
		  interesting places to debug them, and a list of SYSTEM.INI
		  switches that I can never remember.
		Fix bug during freeing of the environment before going resident.
		An error message is added in case we can't open SYSTEM.INI.

SWATVER.ASM	The version # is up to 2.58.
		The defines controlling the version info are completely redone.

SWATVXD.ASM	Ralph Lipe's telephone number is removed from the comments
		  as he's proven to be a bastard.
		V86MMGR.INC is in included so we can use and hook its services.
		The error message EXTRNs are cleaned up and updated.
		A constant string is added to help search for WINA20.386.
		Globals are provided in which to remember the original addresses
		  of services we've hooked.
		Code is added to trundle the WIN386 device list looking for
		  WINA20.386.
		Code is added to check the state of SystemROMBreakPoint.
		Services are hooked to reverse engineer the API translation
		  mapping buffer system to help reduce the low DOS footprint.
		Code is added to the device list trundler to allow a new syntax
		  on the DEBUGVXD= SYSTEM.INI switch.  Specifying no message
		  numbers following the device name tell SWATVXD to hook the
		  device but install no breakpoints.  This way SWATVXD remembers
		  what device was last active and displays this when it pops
		  up.
		A bug is fixed that caused a major crash if the size of
		  386SWAT.LOD exceeded 1 MB.  The GDT descriptors now can
		  use 4 KB granularity in that case.
		Code is added (and now commented out) to trap errant calls
		  to page mapping services where the input page # is below
		  10h.	This was part of the bug in 386MAX.VXD's VGASWAP
		  support that caused WINA20.386 to not work properly.
		Code is added to hook the Shell VxD service, SHELL_MESSAGE,
		  to help debug a VGASWAP problem when VxDs requested
		  the message mode.  This turned out to mostly be a problem
		  in a Beta version of Windows 3.1.

SWAT_MSG.ASM	Error message texts have CR/LF/NUL sequences at the end so they
		  may be sent either to the debugging monochrome monitor via
		  SWATVXD services, or to WDEB386.
		Message text is added to announce when SystemROMBreakPoint isn't
		  set to FALSE.
		Message text is added to announce when WINA20.386 is or isn't
		  loaded.
		Message text is added to announce when PhysIntoV86, MapIntoV86,
		  or LinMapIntoV86 VMMcall services are used with a page #
		  below 10h.
		Message text is added to display interesting bits about the
		  SetMappingInfo, AllocateGlobalV86DataArea, and
		  V86MMGR_Get_Mapping_Info services.

SWAT_RMI.ASM	The 386MAX version # check is removed.	I got sick of being
		  told the versions didn't match, and I'll know when it
		  doesn't work.

SWAT_SVC.ASM	The SWATVXD service to display debugging info is changed to
		  also send the output to WDEB386.
		Some ASSUME statements are corrected.
		Some comments are cleaned up.
