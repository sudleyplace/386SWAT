* Don't close STDIN if 386MAX$$ isn't installed

  Description:	The 386MAX.SYS detection code incorrectly closed STDIN if
		386MAX wasn't installed.  You couldn't hit any key to continue.
  When:  13 APR 93.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Debugging Windows
  Symptom:  System appears to be wedged up after SWATVXD reports 386MAX isn't
	    installed.
  Temporary Workaround:  Don't load SWATVXD if 386MAX isn't installed.
  Version:  2.79

* Announce the presence of the Windows for Workgroups VxDs.

  Description:	To leave some character behind for others, I now display a
		message if the WFW devices are installed.  This saves some
		time barking up the wrong tree.
  When:  13 APR 93.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Debugging Windows
  Symptom:  New line of output on the mono screen or WDEB386 terminal.
  Temporary Workaround:  None, it's not a bug.
  Version:  2.80

* Add PM_BIOS to the symbol support and /? screen

  Description:	Since the Thinkpad is becoming more of a problem, I've added
		some information about the PM_BIOS.386 device to the SWATVXD
		/? output.  It and the WFW SERVER have also been added to the
		symbols sent to SWAT.
		386SWAT.LOD has been changed to display these VxD's services
		when disassembling INT 20h under Windows' GDT/IDT.
  When:  13 APR 93.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Debugging Windows
  Symptom:  New symbols and help output magically show up.
  Temporary Workaround:  None, it's not a bug.
  Version:  2.81

===============================================================================

Here's what's changed and how:

All the files involved have the copyright changed to include 1993.
All the link requirements, etc. have been removed.

MAKEFILE		Add dependencies for PM_BIOS.INC and WFW.INC
			Change the VMAX directory name to match the name
			  WIN3VXD as used on the P: drive and the build machine.

SWATVER.ASM		Bumped the version # to 2.81.

SWATVXD.ASM		Print a message if WFW devices are installed.

SWAT_MSG.ASM		Add message for WFW.

SWAT_RMI.ASM		Don't close STDIN if 386MAX.SYS isn't installed.

SWAT_SYM.ASM		Add symbols for SERVER.386 and PM_BIOS.386.

The following two files are ripped off from the 386MAX.VXD project.
PM_BIOS.INC		New include file for Thinkpad PM_BIOS.386
WFW.INC 		New (not really) include file for WFW devices
