	Add symbol support to SWATVXD.
	New utility program, CATSSF, added to the project.
	Move the SYSTEM.INI cookies from [386Enh] to [386SWAT].
	General cleanup.

Here's what's changed and how:

MAKEFILE	Added macros and equates to build C-based projects.
		Added CATSSF tool to the project.
		Added WIN.SFF to the project.  This .SSF file is a CATSSF
		  of the symbols from SWATVXD.EXE and 386MAX.VXD.
		Add /V:300 to ADDHDR command to mark SWATVXD as Windows 3.0
		  compatible.  This is required now that we're using the
		  ADDHDR binary from the Windows 3.1 DDK.
		Add VMM.INC from the Windows 3.1 DDK to the project.  This
		  allows local mods without wrecking the original file.
		  This also avoids confusion on the build machines.
		Add CodeView information to SWATVXD as part of the new symbol
		  support, current under construction.

SWATVER.ASM	Bump version number from 2.58 to 2.66.	This numbers in between
		  have been used for local un-TWTed versions of SWATVXD.

SWATSTUB.ASM	Add the standard Qualitas module description.
		Remove local definition of WIN386_Startup_Info_Struc.
		Include INT2FAPI.INC from the DDK.
		Change SWATVXD /? text to display more VxDs as well as the
		  numbers for the VMM callout events.  This is useful when
		  setting up the DebugVxD= lines in SYSTEM.INI.
		Stop reading and displaying info from SYSTEM.INI.

SWAT_SVC.ASM	Move PVCS $Header$ to top of the file.
		Update the copyright.
		Change VMM.INC comment to match the others.

SWAT_RMI.ASM	Move PVCS $Header$ to top of the file.
		Update the copyright.
		Change VMM.INC comment to match the others.
		Add a bunch of global variables to support new SYSTEM.INI
		  processing, as well as cleaner code in general.
		Add a bunch of global variables to support the .SSF processing.
		Add additional comments at SWAT_RMI describing the entry
		  conditions for Windows 3.1.
		Save entry-time variables from registers to globals for use
		  later.
		Check for duplicate installations in a subroutine.
		Use the new Windows 3.1 loader services to read SYSTEM.INI
		  checking for the RealModeBreak cookie.
		Add a generalized failure case in the exit code.
		Add proper ASSUMEs to all the procedures.
		Comment out dead GET_WINDIR procedure.	Install new one.
		  Still needs work.
		Add RMI_STRLEN procedure.
		Add LOAD_SSF procedure to process .SSF files.  Code ripped-off
		  from SWATRUN.COM and modified to work in the VxD environment.

SWAT_MSG.ASM	Move PVCS $Header$ to top of the file.
		Update the copyright.
		Change VMM.INC comment to match the others.
		Fix typos in message text.
		Add messages related to symbol support.

SWAT_VXD.ASM	Move PVCS $Header$ to top of the file.
		Update the copyright.
		Remove phonebook.
		Change VMM.INC comment to match the others.
		Add new include file SWAT_SYM.INC.
		Add VCPI.INC to support symbols.
		Realign tabs on global variables.
		Add FAR CALL vectors to SWAT's INT 67h handler.
		Remove dead globals and generally cleanup global area.
		Add search strings for symbol support.
		Add DEVICE_SERVICE_STR to define VxDs we have symbols for.
		Define text strings for symbols we know about in VxDs.
		Add procedures to return the absolute addresses to help find
		  the bases of IGROUP and LGROUP.
		Add additional comments to various VMM callout message handlers
		  describing their entry conditions.
		Call the new procedures to setup symbols for VMM and .SSFs.
		Comment-out and remove old hooks used for debugging various
		  386MAX.VXD problems along the way.
		Change all SYSTEM.INI cookies so they are found in a new
		  [386SWAT] section, rather than in [386Enh].
		Add a new procudure to rummage around in WIN386 and root out
		  the symbols of the VxD services.
		Add STRLEN procedure.
		Add a new procedure to setup symbols for SWATVXD and 386MAX.VXD
		  via a .SSF file.
		Add a new procedure to trundle down the Device_List looking for
		  a particular VxD.  Remove old inline code with calls to it.
		Remove code that Assign_Device_V86_Pages the mono area.
		Add code in reference data processing that checks the 386SWAT
		  version and picks up additional info from SWAT_INFO.	This
		  is used for symbol support.
		Comment-out mode old hook code.  Probably we can delete it.
