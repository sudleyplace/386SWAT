Workaround RAM Doubler VxD Peculiarity

The RAM Doubler VxD, in its Sys_Critical_Init section, does something
odd:  it checks the selector of IRQs 0-7, and if it is not that of
Windows (28h), it fails.  Because SWAT may hook one of those IRQs, we
need to do something special.  In particular, in our Sys_Critical_Init
section, we now check for the same scenario that Ram Doubler does, and
if found, we rehook the IRQ and point it to a local routine (which by
definition, uses the Windows selector).

Because this oddity might occur in other VxDs, I also implemented a
new keyword (HookIRQ) which forces the above rehooking even if RAM
Doubler is not present.


SWATSINI.INC	Define new keyword.

SWAT_DBG.INC	Define flag for new keyword.

SWATSTUB.ASM	Document new keyword.

SWATVER.ASM	Bump version #.

SWATVXD.ASM	Define array of pointers to local IRQ handlers.
		Define array of save areas for old IRQ handlers.
		Define local IRQ handlers.
		Define routine to hook IRQ handlers.
		Trundle through the device list looking for RAM
		  Doubler VxD.
		Check for new keyword in SYSTEM.INI.
