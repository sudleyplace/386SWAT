
P:\TWT\NOSWAT.WRL

This TWT adds and/or changes:

	Support for the v0.11 .SSF file format.

	Stop using CATSSF to build WIN.SFF.

	Add NOSWAT option to the WIN.COM command line to keep SWATVXD from
	installing.  This allows the use of other debuggers like Soft-ICE/W
	without rebooting.  When found, the NOSWAT option is blanked out
	of the command line to avoid a warning from PROGMAN.

	Add SYSTEM.INI switches to the /? help text.

	Don't undo the HookVxD= apparatus at SystemExit if using the
	DebugThruExit=ON option.  This allows debugging other VxD's easily
	at SystemExit and SysCriticalExit.

* Add support for the v0.11 .SSF file format.

  Description:	Add support for the v0.11 .SSF file format.
		The new file format uses an LSEEK address at offset 0Ah in
		the .SSF file.	The older format assumes the size of the header.
		The old format is still supported.
  When:  14 SEP 92.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Windows debugging
  Symptom:  SWATVXD symbolic debugging stops working after you get a new MAPSSF.
  Temporary Workaround:  None.
  Version:  2.74

* Use MAPSSF -t rather than CATSSF to build the combined WIN.SSF file.

  Description:	MAPSSF now works properly when building concatenated .SSF files.
		CATSSF is no longer used in the MAKEFILE.
  When:  14 SEP 92.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Windows debugging
  Symptom:  None, it's not a bug.
  Temporary Workaround:  None, it's not a bug.
  Version:  2.74

* Add NOSWAT option to the WIN.COM command line.

  Description:	Using other Windows debuggers like Soft-ICE/W or CVW in the
		presence of SWATVXD can be a pain.  (Sometimes it's damn useful)
		This changes let's you type 'WIN NOSWAT' to start Windows
		without the SWATVXD.  The option is blanked from the command
		line to avoid a complaint from PROGMAN.
  When:  14 SEP 92.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Windows debugging
  Symptom:  None, it's not a bug.
  Temporary Workaround:  None, it's not a bug.
  Version:  2.74

* Add SYSTEM.INI switches to the /? help text.

  Description:	Remembering all the SWATVXD SYSTEM.INI options is getting
		more difficult.  The /? help text now shows 'em.
  When:  14 SEP 92.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Windows debugging
  Symptom:  None, it's not a bug.
  Temporary Workaround:  None, it's not a bug.
  Version:  2.74

* Don't undo the HookVxD= apparatus at SystemExit if using DebugThruExit=ON.

  Description:	Don't undo the HookVxD= apparatus at SystemExit if using the
		DebugThruExit=ON option.  This allows debugging other VxD's
		easily at SystemExit and SysCriticalExit.
  When:  14 SEP 92.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment: Windows debugging
  Symptom:  None, it's not a bug.
  Temporary Workaround:  None, it's not a bug.
  Version:  2.74

Here's what's changed and how:

MAKEFILE		C/C++ 7.0 CL and LINK is now on my path.
			Switch to using the newer MAPSSF -t and -w switches.
			Don't run CATSSF to create WIN.SSF.

CATSSF.C		Updated to the new .SSF file format.

SWATVER.ASM		Bumped the version number to 2.74.

SWATVXD.ASM		Don't undo the HookVxD= hooks if DebugThruExit=ON.

SWATSTUB.ASM		Add the list of SYSTEM.INI switches to the help text.
			Add the VKD and InitPS2MouseAtExit= to the help text.
			Shift everything in the help text left as far as
			  possible to avoid wrapped source lines.

SWAT_MSG.ASM		Add 'SWATVXD Not Installing Due to NOSWAT Option' text.

SWAT_RMI.ASM		Add code to watch for the NOSWAT option on the
			  WIN.COM command line.
			Use PSPGRP to reference data in the PSP rather than
			  the absolute offsets.
			Use the SSF_STR from SWAT_SSF.INC rather than defining
			  it locally.
			Add the SkipWhiteESDI routine.
			Add support for the 0.11 .SSF file format.
