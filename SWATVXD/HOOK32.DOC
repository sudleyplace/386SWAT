Widen HookVxD and HookPM Bitmaps To Accommodate More Functions

The code which handles the HookVxD= and HookPM= keywords in the
[386SWAT] section of SYSTEM.INI was limited to VxD and PM function
numbers 0-31.  Win95 apparently uses higher function numbers, so we
need to widen the dword bitmaps used to two dwords so we can handle
functions up to 63.

MAKEFILE	Re-order rules to LIFO order as that's the way NMAKE
		  works.
		Use local copy of SWATSTUB.EXE in dependency checks as
		  that's the one which is updated locally.

SWATHOOK.INC	Widen bitmap fields for VxD and PM hooks.

SWATVER.ASM	Bump the version #.

SWATVXD.ASM	Widen VxD and PM hook bitmap fields using local
		  storage instead of register.
