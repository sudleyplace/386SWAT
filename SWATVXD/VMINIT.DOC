Allow Traps On VM_Init Calls

While debugging a Netware problem, I found I needed to trap on VM_Init
calls.

At the same time, the copyright notice is updated and made consistent
in all places.

MAKEFILE	Delete NEWDIR action for SWATSTUB.EXE as it's copied
		  elsewhere.

SWATSINI.INC	Define keyword for VM_Init calls.

SWATVER.INC	Use consistent equate for copyright message.

SWAT_DBG.INC	Define flag for VM_Init calls.

SWATSTUB.ASM	Use consistent equate for copyright message.
		Document SWATVMInit keyword.

SWATVER.ASM	Bump version #.

SWATVXD.ASM	Check for SWATVMInit keyword.
		In VM_Init, test for SWATVMInit flag.

SWAT_MSG.ASM	Use consistent equate for copyright message.

SWAT_SVC.ASM	Use consistent equate for copyright message.
