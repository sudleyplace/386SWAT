386SWAT symbolic debugging

This document covers the basics of symbolic debugging support for
386SWAT.  The 386SWAT API specifics are documented elsewhere; here we
will describe actual usage of SWAT for symbolic debugging, and the
tools needed to load symbols.

There are three sections:
386SWAT - new profile options and commands
SWATRUN - program loader for debugging .COM and .EXE files
MAPSSF  - symbol loader/translator

386SWAT
Three profile options are new to SWAT:

SYMSIZE=n	This option sets the number of bytes to be used for the
		SWAT symbol table.  The internal format of SWAT's symbol
		table is 12 bytes larger than the symbol table used for
		the SWAT API calls.  Each public or line number occupies
		23 bytes plus the length of the symbol name.

		SYMSIZE is used to calculate a default value for BUCKETS
		(described below).  If BUCKETS is not explicitly defined
		in the profile, it will be set to min (255, max (1,
		SYMSIZE / 4096)).

		If SYMSIZE is not specified, it will default to 4096 bytes.
		The default BUCKETS value (if also not specified) will then
		be 1.  See below for BUCKETS storage requirements.

BUCKETS=n	Specify number of 1K blocks to be used for symbol name
		hashing.  Values less than 1 and over 255 are ignored.

		To speed symbol name searches, all names are hashed using
		the following algorithm:

		extern unsigned int HASHPRIME;

		int hashpjw(char *s)
		{
		 char *p;
		 unsigned long h=0, g;

		 for (p=s; *p; p++) {
			h = (h << 4) + (unsigned) tolower (*p);
			if (g = (h & 0xf0000000)) {
			  h = h ^ (g >> 24);
			  h = h ^ g;
			}
		 }

		 return ((int) (h % HASHPRIME));

		}

		HASHPRIME is derived from a table of prime numbers closest
		to multiples of 256.  Here are some examples:
		BUCKETS		HASHPRIME
		1		257
		2		509
		3		769
		254		65027
		255		65287

		The storage occupied by the name hashing table is
		HASHPRIMES[BUCKETS-1] * 4, or approximately BUCKETS * 1K.

		When a hash value is calculated from a name, that value is
		shifted left 2 bits and used as an index into the table
		of dword bucket pointers based at the address contained
		in SYMNHASH.  A bucket pointer may contain -1 (FFFFFFFF)
		or an offset from the address contained in SYMBASE.  In
		this case, a "bucket" actually points to a symbol record.
		Next name pointers in each symbol record form a linked
		list which may be traversed to find an exact name match.

		The smaller the BUCKETS value, the longer these bucket
		chains will be, thus increasing name search time.  This
		is only likely to be a performance hit when loading
		symbols, since SWAT checks for existing symbols by name.
		Searches for symbols entered at the command line would
		not be visibly impacted by longer searches.

ADDRHBITS=n	Specify number of address bits to use for address hash
		table.  Values less than 8 and over 12 are ignored.

		Address hash table storage in bytes is 2 ^ (ADDRHBITS + 1).
		The minimum is therefore 1K and the maximum, 16K.

		ADDRHBITS defaults to 12.  When symbols are present,
		all possible addresses in the disassembly screen
		are searched against the address hash table.  Possible
		hits require traversal of the address hash buckets chain,
		similar to name hash bucket traversal.  A "next address
		bucket" pointer is part of the symbol record.  Thus the
		set of symbol records forms two interleaved linked lists:
		the address bucket chain and the name bucket chain.

		The number of bits specified by ADDRHBITS are taken from
		a resolved linear address, shifted left 2 bits, and used
		as an index into the table of dword pointers based at the
		address contained in SYMNHASH.  The address pointed to is
		an offset from the address in SYMBASE, and points to the
		beginning symbol record in that address bucket chain.  If
		the value is -1 (FFFFFFFF), there is no such address.

		Smaller address hash tables may significantly impact
		unassembly.

Using symbols
Any symbol may be used as an effective address.  For example,
dd 180|{SYMHASH
will display the symbol address hash table.  Symbol display will occur
automatically if the symbols are loaded properly.  See sections below
on SWATRUN and MAPSSF.

Symbols are displayed in the Unassemble (F9) screen.  Code addresses
may be displayed as public names or line numbers (if line numbers
were specified with the linker's /LI option).  Addresses within the
unassembly are handled as intelligently as possible.  For example,
mov ax,[bx+7c39]
may be displayed as
mov ax,[bx+FOOBAR]
if FOOBAR's offset is 7c39 and the default segment/selector (DS in this case)
matches the segment/selector specified for the symbol FOOBAR.

SWAT cannot resolve addresses CLOSE TO symbols; a construction commonly
seen in C code might be:
mov [FOOBAR],bx
mov [7c3b],es
A future enhancement might be to unassemble this as
mov [FOOBAR+2],es

New commands within SWAT

Syntax: SWATRUN [options] progname.ext [arguments]
  Valid options are:
    /b   Generate Int 1 at beginning of SWATRUN
    /mMAPFILE Load MAPFILE instead of progname.map
    /n   Do not call MAPSSF.EXE to load symbols
    /o   Overwrite existing SWAT symbols
    /?   Display this message

MapSSF [options] fspec1 [fspec2 [...]]
All options are preceded with - or /:
  -x#           set debugging level to # (default is 0 -- no messages)
  -o            overwrite existing symbol table (default is append)
  -y            default to recognizing files as SYM32 format
  -g#,#         restrict symbol group types to specified #'s
  -sxxxxm       set selector to xxxx hex, where m is
                v for V86/real mode
                v+ for V86/real mode, add value to segment,
                p for protected mode
  -tfname       echo SWAT tables to file fname
  -wfname[.wsg] read Windows Symbol Group file fname.wsg
  -l            ignore line number information in .MAP file
  -n            sort symbols by name (default is by value)
