Allow loading of SSF files in SWATRUN

The original design of SWATRUN invoked %COMSPEC% /c mapssf -sxxxxv+ mapname
to toss the burden of loading symbols for debugging onto MAPSSF's
shoulders.

To support faster loading (by eliminating the time required to parse
the map file), SWATRUN now loads .SSF files produced by MAPSSF and
provides the appropriate fixups for real mode symbols.

Some other fixes and enhancements are included at no extra cost.

Files affected:
SWATRUN.ASM	Added /Ssymfilename to support explicit loading of
		.SSF files.

		Added extension search to look for .ssf then .map
		file before deciding to call Load_ssf or invoke
		MAPSSF.

		Changed "Calling MAPPSF to load program" message
		so that it displays the fully qualified pathname
		of the program and the load address.

		Increased stack by 50% because MAPSSF sometimes
		dips into our messages.

		Added text to /? help message explaining .ssf/.map
		search procedure.

		Added automatic binary extension search.  We look
		first for .COM then .EXE only if no extension (or
		".") is specified.

		Added code and structures to load from SSF file,
		fix up, and pass to SWAT symbol data.

		Renamed /N(omap) option /N(osymbols).

		Added message to end of "Loading progname at xxxx " line.
		Different text displayed depending on whether it's a
		mapssf, direct ssf, or no symbols were found.

		Fix bug where we included CR in command tail length
		byte.

		Expand all filenames to fully qualified pathnames,
		including drive letter.  This emulates COMMAND.COM's
		behavior and makes argv[0] available as many of our
		programs expect it.
