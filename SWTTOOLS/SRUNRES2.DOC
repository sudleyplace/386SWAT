Fix bug in SWATRUN

When changes were made to SWATRUN to reduce the resident size,
the case where the client environment is larger than that of
SWATRUN's parent was missing a screw.

SWATRUN would check to see if the PSP storage calculated for the
program being loaded was contiguous with SWATRUN's PSP storage.
If so, SWATRUN's secondary resident storage would be subtracted
from the resulting address calculation.  This first case will
hold true when the size of the environment needed for the client
program is less than or equal to SWATRUN's initial environment;
after SWATRUN frees its environment, the next reallocation that
fits will re-use it.  It will also hold true if the client's
environment size is larger, but an already existing hole in the
MAC fills the bill.

Note that variations in environment size are caused by the
length of the complete program path, which is saved in the
STRINGS section of the environment when the program is loaded.

The case we address in this TWT is where the client's environment
is contiguous with SWATRUN's PSP storage, and the client's PSP
storage is in turn contiguous with its environment.  There should
be no case where neither of these conditions hold true, but we
check anyway and crap out if we detect a discrepancy.
