Add default group option to MAPSSF
Add LIBSYM tool

Two new options are added to MAPSSF:

1. The -e# option (-g is already taken) allows one to set the
   default group number a la LIBSYM.  This is useful for application
   with WINSWAT where you don't need a .WSG file.

2. The -p option makes all segments not covered in a .WSG file
   protected mode selectors.  This is also primarily for use
   with WINSWAT.

Files affected:

LIBSYM.C	(New) Tool to read output from EXEHDR.	This was a lazy
			way to avoid reading the new .EXE file format and getting
			the export list.

LOADMAP.C	Add modname#selNNN symbols to SWAT for each selector loaded.
			We only do this for segment ordinals < 256 and > 0, which
			is the case for segments in Windows PM executables.  If
			this turns out to be too restrictive we could add an option
			at a later date.

			In case we've enabled duplicate symbols, don't try to add
			the modname#selNNN symbol more than once.

			Treat Imp (imports; seg:offset is always 0:0) symbols as
			Abs.  We can get them via EXEHDR filename.exe | libsym.

MAKEFILE	Remove log from SWAT tools makefile.

			Use large model for MAPSSF.

			Generate .SSF files for all tools.

			Add new tool, LIBSYM.

MAPSSF.C	Update copyright.

			Rev version (skipping 1.13 since that's been out unofficially
			for some time).

			Add new options -p (default PM selector) and -e# (default
			group number).

			Fix an old bug (the fix has been in 1.13) in matching
			.WSG addresses.

			Set default mode and group for all symbols, including those
			not addressed by the .WSG file (if one exists).

			Fix another old bug in parsing arguments.

MAPSSF.H	Modify to work with large model.
