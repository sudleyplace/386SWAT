Handle programs requiring SETVER information

SWATRUN now calls the undocumented DOS 5 Enter EXEC State function
before executing client programs.  Numerous other fixes are included.

SWATRUN has also been reorganized somewhat to handle the new SSF file
structure (file version 0.11).	Some definitions have been moved into
SWAT_SSF.INC, which SWATRUN now shares.

A copy of SWAT_SSF.INC is included with this TWT for clarification,
although it is being reviewed as part of the swat\symload.hg TWT.

Files affected:

MAKEFILE	Define SWAT include directory.
		Generate .SSF file.
		Add new dependency.

SWATRUN.ASM	Add DOS 5 Enter EXEC State call.

		Use @MAX_PATH equate for maximum path length.  This is
		currently 128 to accomodate networks.

		Moved structure and flag definitions into SWAT_SSF.INC.

		Eliminated other definitions which could be taken from
		SWAT_SYM.INC.

		Added support for SSF file version 0.11 with embedded
		flags (currently, only the overwrite and allow duplicates
		flags are supported).

		Increased stack size to avoid stepping on separator message.

		Display path name as part of 'EXEC load failed' message.
		Note that this path name may not be the same as the one
		the user intended; QualifyPath expands the filename into
		a full d:\dir\fname.exe path.

		If Load_SSF fails (invalid filename or not an SSF file)
		we display a generic error message to let the user know
		the symbol load failed.

		Added DOS version check (won't run if DOS version < 3.0).

		Added check for Caps Lock.  This allows a breakpoint to
		be triggered in SWATRUN before the command line options
		are processed.

		Fixed bug where we may not properly handle SWATRUN /o vs.
		SWATRUN -o.

		Previously, we added a \r\0 in GET_ALTMAP, assuming we
		are processing a command tail.	This invalidates any
		ASCIIZ filename, as we may have when processing an
		explicit /sfilename.ext.  GET_ALTMAP now takes a
		terminator in BX.

		In QualifyPath, we must now read the EXE header to create
		the block needed for the EES call.

		Fixed bug in QualifyPath where we did not properly handle
		files in the root directory.
