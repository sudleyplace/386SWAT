Allow SWATCMD with no arguments to generate an Int 3
Process quoted values in SWATCMD argument list

This is useful for bringing up SWAT at a point where DOS
services are available via PL0 DPMI (if LOADSYM is present
in the profile).

To pass expressions like
	e 70|4*e0 67
SWATCMD needs to support double quotes, since
	SWATCMD e 70|4*e0 67
would have DOS trying to execute 4*e0 with SWATCMD's output
piped in as standard input.
	SWATCMD "e 70|4*e0 67"
works as expected.

To pass double quotes to SWAT, repeat them:
	SWATCMD "s 0|0 9fff0 ""386"""
searches for the string "386" (note that we need to enclose
the command line in double quotes as well since it contains
a stile).

Files affected:

SWATCMD.ASM	Remove Caps Lock code.

		Bump version number.

		Strip double quotes (") from command line so we can
		pass stile (|) to SWAT.

		Generate an Int 3 before bitching about missing
		command line in case that's what was desired.
