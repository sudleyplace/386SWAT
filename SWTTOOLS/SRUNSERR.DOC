Use STDERR for SWATRUN and MAPSSF intermediate output

When debugging programs like QSORT that normally redirect their
output, it is useful to still have the debugger loader display
its intermediate messages via standard error so the STDOUT contents
are the same irregardless of whether the debugger loader is used
or not.

Files affected:

MAKEFILE	Change rules for SWATRUN.COM so it depends on
		SWATRUN.OBJ rather than on SWATRUN.ASM directly.

MAPSSF.C	Bump version number.

		Display copyright notice via STDERR.

SWATRUN.ASM	Use nulls to terminate messages.

		Add message display routine for ASCIIZ strings.

		Display all messages to standard error.

		Bump version number.

		Eliminate code needed to display ASCIIZ string using
		DOS @STROUT.

		If no dot specified in filename, assume extension
		of .COM or .EXE.  To load a binary file called FOO
		for debugging, it would be necessary to enter
		SWATRUN foo.
