Allow MAPSSF to read TLINK-generated MAP files

Ideal mode assembly and linking with Borland's TASM and TLINK
generates a MAP file with a slightly different format.	When
reading the Publics by Name section, we check to see if there
is a third token on the line.  If so, we take that one instead
of the second.

Files affected:
LOADMAP.C	If token 3 is not empty, use it for symbol name.

MAPSSF.C	Cleaned up file and reorganized options into
		alphabetical order in help and in switch () {}.

		If no extension specified when generating .SSF
		file with -t option, add .SSF to name.
