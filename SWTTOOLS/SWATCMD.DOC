Execute SWAT commands from CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT

SWATCMD may be loaded as a non-resident device driver,
via INSTALL=, or from COMMAND.COM.  It passes its argument
list in toto to 386SWAT via a VCPI command line interface.

Files affected:

MAKEFILE	Add dependencies for SWATCMD and SWATLOG.

SWATCMD.ASM	(New) Source for SWATCMD.EXE.

SWATCMD.C	Fix bug in C example source.  The SWATCMD built from
		this source cannot be loaded from CONFIG.SYS.  This
		is useful only as an example of using the API.

SWATLOG.C	(New) Program to copy standard input or a text file
		to the SWAT log.
