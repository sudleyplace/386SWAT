Fix bug in MAPSSF when dealing with protected mode symbols

When MAPSSF processes addresses, it needs to normalize them
to 20-bit values when matching segments.  In CHECK_WSG(),
we don't want to denormalize V86 or protected mode addresses;
we should always leave the offset alone and blast in the
segment value specified in the WSG file.  V86 symbols will
have to be fixed up from the SWAT command line with the
ts command.

Currently, the only use for V86 symbols in WSG files is
deleting them via the D flag.
