Change structure of SSF files produced by MAPSSF

For the first time we are changing the format of the header
in SSF files produced by MAPSSF with the -t option.  One of
the fields in this header is the file version number, which
is going from 0.10 to 0.11.

One of the advantages of this new format is that is more
easily extensible.  A long pointer to data gives us a value
we can use to seek to the start of the actual symbol data.
A word of processing flags gives us a mechanism to pass
options to SWATRUN or 386SWAT.	Currently, the only flags
supported are overwrite table and allow duplicates.

A new MAPSSF option, -d, uses the SWAT raw symbol append
VCPI call to pass symbols to SWAT.  This allows multiple
instances of a single symbol name with different values.
This is useful when a single name may appear in several
different addresses.  When the name is used as a search
token, the linear address of the last instance added to
SWAT will be used.

Files affected:

MAPSSF.C	Bump version number.
		Implement -d (allow duplicates) option.
		Defined SSF file header as a structure.
		Increased tolerance for time differences from 4 to 12 seconds.
		Reorganized syntax help message.
		Removed commented-out code.
		Support -? and -h for syntax help.

SWAT_API.ASM	Use raw symbol append call to add symbols to SWAT
		when -d option is used.
