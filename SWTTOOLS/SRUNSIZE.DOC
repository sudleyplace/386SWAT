Reduce size of SWATRUN.COM

When the code to load SSF files directly was added to SWATRUN,
the static buffer for disk reads added 16K to SWATRUN.COM.  We
now allocate this buffer dynamically using DOS GETMEM.

Files affected:
SWATRUN.ASM	Moved Load_SSF data into resident data segment.
		Instead of static buffer, use a pointer for reads.
		Ensure that we always display separator after
		loading symbols.
