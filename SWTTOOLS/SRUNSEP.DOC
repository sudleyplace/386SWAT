Allow SWATRUN to parse command line separators

At the cost of not being able to parse command paths containing
forward slash (/), SWATRUN will now properly handle lines like
SWATRUN c:\386max\install/r/k.	This is a small price to pay, since
COMMAND.COM won't parse c:/386max/install anyway without changing
the default command separator list.

Files affected:

SWATRUN.ASM	Bump version.

		Add list of command terminators, including CR, LF, and 0.

		Moved code and data for symbol file search to non-resident
		code/data segments.

		In resident code where we load symbols or call MAPSSF,
		check flags to see if we should display the "Symbol file
		not found" message.

		Define and use IZITSEP to check for the end of a filename
		on the command line.
