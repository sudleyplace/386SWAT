Changes to SWAT tools for device driver version of SWAT

Now that SWAT can run without MAX by loading as a device driver,
some minor changes are needed to MAPSSF and SWATRUN so that they
don't insist on MAX being present.

A minor enhancement to WSG file syntax allows the segments of
V86 mode group ID's to be preserved.

Files affected:

MAKEFILE	Link common SWATPRES module with MAPSSF and SWATRUN.

MAPSSF.C	Include prototype for MASM functions.

		Bump version.

		Don't replace segment if * specified.

		Parse * in WSG file for V86 mode segments only.

		Call SWAT_PRESENT() before trying to load symbols.

MAPSSF.H	Define flags in WSG record.

QMAX.WSG	Put all initialization time V86-mode segments in
		group ID 3010, and keep the map file segments.
		At DEBUG=CAPS time, they can be fixed up by typing
		ts * 3010 * cs+

SWAT_API.ASM	Ripped out useless IS_VM().  Its original intention
		is served by SWAT_PRESENT() in SWATPRES.ASM.

SWAT_API.PRO	Added prototype for SWAT_PRESENT().  It is declared
		far so it can stay in PGROUP rather than DGROUP.

SWATPRES.ASM	(New) Code common to SWATRUN.COM and MAPSSF.EXE.  It
		is set up to 1) be callable from assembler and C code
		and 2) to not generate any segment fixups so SWATRUN
		can call it with an FCALL macro.

SWATRUN.ASM	Bump version.

		Remove obsolete messages.

		Move 386SWAT presence check to SWATPRES.ASM.

		Put .8086 - DOT386 around code that may be run on
		where CPU < 386.

		Removed CPUTYPE.  This is the first thing we check
		for in SWAT_PRESENT.

		Commented out code for MAX presence check.
