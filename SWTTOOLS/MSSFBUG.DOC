Fix bug in MAPSSF

MAPSSF was making the wrong call to add symbols to SWAT.  Rather than
using the raw append (allow duplicates) service only when the -d switch
is used, MAPSSF would use raw append only when -d is NOT specified.

This only applies to loading .MAP files directly into SWAT.  SSF files
would be created properly.  If SSF files are loaded via SWAT loadsym=
or ls commands, or with SWATRUN, everything would work as expected.

Files affected:

MAPSSF.C	Bump version.

SWAT_API.ASM	Fix incorrect test.
