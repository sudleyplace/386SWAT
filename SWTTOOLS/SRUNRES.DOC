Reduce resident size of SWATRUN

When SWATRUN is used to load programs, the loading will now occur
at a lower address.  Only the minimum of code and data for keeping
a separate stack and for cleanup purposes is needed.  After the
non-resident initialization is complete, SWATRUN frees the non-
resident code and data.  We calculate the client program's load
address by freeing our environment (if the parent's PSP has an
environment), adding the environment length to the client's
putative STRINGS section length, allocating the specified paragraphs,
and allocating the maximum possible paragraphs.  This gives us
the high water mark load address DOS should use for the client
program.

If the high water mark load address is contiguous with the end of
SWATRUN's storage, the number of paragraphs to be released when
SWATRUN frees the resident code and data in CODE2 and DATA2 is
subtracted from the high water mark load address.

Previously, SWATRUN called Int 21h 4B01 twice, once to get the load
address, and the second time to do the actual load.  While reliable,
this was a very weak scheme.

SWATRUN will also report the number of symbols not loaded into SWAT.

SWATRUN checks for 386MAX and for a VCPI debugger before continuing.

If a program name is immediately followed by TAB (as opposed to SPACE)
SWATRUN used to choke on it.

Files affected:

MAKEFILE	Add new includes for MAX info structure read.

SWATRUN.ASM	Add new segments for resident code and data which
		will not be needed after the client program loads
		(CODE2/DATA2/DATZ2).

		Move code and data from CODE and DATA to CODE2 and
		DATA2.

		Report symbols to be loaded and number successfully
		loaded if not all symbols in SSF file were loaded.

		Bump version number.

		Check for presence of 386MAX$$.

		Check for presence of VCPI debugger interface.

		Calculate load address using 386LOAD method for
		determining high water mark and adding potential
		savings from unneeded resident code and data.

		Handle filenames terminated by tab.
