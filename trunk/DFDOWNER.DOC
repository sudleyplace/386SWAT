Fix DF Bug in LCL_INT67

If certain functions in our INT 67h handler are called with DF
pointing down, we fail.  This change corrects that by saving the flags
on the stack at the start and restoring them when we exit.

The following modules are changed and why:

SWAT_COM.INC	 Change SETDATA macro to save flags if second
		   parameter is specified.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 Save flags at start of INT 67h handler, clear DF, and
		   restore the flags when we exit.
