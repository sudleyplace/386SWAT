Implement INSERT Command

To debug Windows at the lowest level, we need to be able to insert
ourselves into Windows startup shortly after it enters PM.  To this
end, the INSERT command is available.  It is used from the SWAT
command line at the point just before Windows enters PM.  The syntax
of the command is as follows:

At the same time, the following changes are made:

* Handle case where we're entered in SWATTER on a stack with the B-bit
  clear, we need to clear the high-order word of ESP so we can use it
  as a base register.

* Fix a bug in GD bit handling where we need an INT 01h handler to
  catch our own references to the debug registers.

* Change base selectors for SWAT as we now almost always load it as a
  device driver.

* Simplify DR register handling to respecify DR7 from the internal
  data as opposed to the DRn registers.  Thsi is needed as some
  programs (e.g. Windows) can clobber the DRn registers when we're
  not in control.


The following files are changed and why:

386SWAT.DOC	Document changes.

SWAT.ASM	In SWATTER, handle entry on 16-bit stack.
		Handle GD bit settings.

SWAT.WSG	Change base selectors.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	Place new command into parse table.
		Alphabetize other entries.
		Document other entries as appropriate.

SWAT_DBG.ASM	Simplify DR register handleing.

SWAT_DR2.ASM	Handle GD bit settings.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	Document new command.

SWAT_INI.ASM	Define table for local CR3.
		Move IDT setting entries into separate routine.

SWAT_INT.ASM	Reorganize OLDINTxx and other variables.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	Define additional GDT entries for new command.
		Define action routine for new command.

SWAT_VCP.INC	Define new DTE TSS entries.
