Toggle Default State of LOADHIGH

When I changed SWAT to a USE32 code segment, it got bigger.  So big
that it could blow low DOS memory (overwriting transient CONFIG.SYS
processing) unless LOADHIGH is specified.  This change makes LOADHIGH
the default as well as implements a disabling keyword, LOADLOW (a.k.a.
LOADLO).

The following modules are changed and why:

386SWAT 	 Re-define old LOADHIGH keyword.
		 Define new LOADLOW keyword.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Define entry for new keyword.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Note old keyword is now the default.
		 Define action routine for new keyword.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Mark LOADHIGH as the default state.
		 Change comments from not specifying LOADHIGH to
		   specifying LOADLOW.
