Skip More GP Faults

When debugging under Windows and trapping GP Faults, I found it
convenient to define more instructions to skip when a GP Fault occurs.
This is because Windows runs DOS with IOPL<CPL, thus the instructions
skipped are the IOPL-sensitive ones.

Also included in this change is the inclusion of JCXZ to the list of
instructions which are subject to bookmark (s-F1/s-F2) processing.

The following files are changed and why:

386SWAT 	 Define new keywords to GPSKIP=.

OPODES.INC	 Define opcodes equates.

SWAT_GPS.INC	 Define bit flags/masks for new GPSKIP keywords.

SWAT_AGR.ASM	 Include JCXZ as a bookmark instruction.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define struc and DB entries for new GPSKIP keywords.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 In CHECK_GPS, check for new GPSKIP instructions.
		   Also included are the 32-bit I/O instructions which
		   were omitted.
