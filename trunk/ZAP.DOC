ZAP.MDA

* Add Ctrl-Z command to zap the top instruction

Since converting an instruction to NOPs is a frequently performed
function, a hot-key has been created to easily accomplish this task.
The Ctrl-Z key will convert the top instruction to the appropriate
amount of single byte NOP instructions.

Author's note:
This is useful for removing debugging breakpoints when they are no
longer needed.


Here's what's changed:

SWAT.ASM	- Added Ctrl-Z key definition
