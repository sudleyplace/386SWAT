Validate Back Link In Operand Analysis Display for IRET/D

On occasion, I've had the system go poof on an IRET/D when the NT bit
was set (and I didn't notice that) and the back link TSS was invalid
for some reason (either bad TSS selector, or something was wrong with
the TSS, such as the CR3 value was invalid).  This TWT checks for that
condition and reports it as part of the operand analysis display for
the IRET/D instructions.

At the same time in DISP_OPER, I defined and set variables which hold
the width and limit of the effective address values for use in a later
TWT (GP Faults in Autofault).

MAKEFILE	 Note dependency of SWAT_OPR.ASM on SWAT_CMD.INC.

SWAT_AGR.ASM	 In SELOFF2ADDR, catch invalid selectors at various
		   stages so as to return CF=1 on error.  We need this
		   for the back link checking to work.

SWAT_MSC.ASM	 Define GETLIMIT routine to return selector limit.
		 In GETARWBASE, catch zero selector as error.

SWAT_OPR.ASM	 Define and set EA1WID, EA2WID, EA1LIM, and EA2LIM.
		 Fix bug in OPCOD1 table for computing length of 0EAh
		   opcode (far jump immediate).
		 Define messages for back link errors.
		 In DISP_REF, if VM=0 and NT=1 on an IRET/D, check the
		   back link and display it for operand analysis.
		 In GETILEN, check the DC/COD/B-bits in the incoming
		   DS to set $OSP and $ASP appropriately.
