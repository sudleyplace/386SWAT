Handle New Windows Keyboard Keys

The Microsoft Natural keyboard contains three new keys:

* Left Windows key
* Right Windows key
* Application key

These keys have new scan codes which our keyboard handler now
recognizes, although we don't do much with them as yet.  The left and
right Windows keys are meant to be modifiers just as Shift, Ctl-, and
Alt-keys are modifiers.  The Application key is meant to be an actual
keystroke, so I've assigned arbitrary key codes to it in its
Unshifted, Shift-, Ctl-, and Alt-states.

For the moment, until someone can think of something better, the
Application key invokes the Help menu.


SWAT.ASM	Add support for AWIN to invoke Help window.

SWAT_KEY.ASM	Handle left and right Windows keys as new modifiers.

SWAT_KT2.ASM	Include new keys in international tables.

SWAT_KTB.ASM	Include new keys in default table.
