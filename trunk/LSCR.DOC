Implement profile option to control the number of last screen buffers
saved by SWAT.	Previously, we used a default of sixteen buffers; now
that number can be changed to any value.  Each screen buffer uses 4000
bytes of extended memory.  The modules changed and why are as follows:

SWAT.ASM	 Increase # digits in "Last Screen-xxx" message.
		 Convert usage of NLSTBUF from ABS to WORD.
		 Convert usage of PLSTBUF_TAB from table of ptrs to
		   ptr to table of ptrs (PPLSTBUF_TAB).

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Include SAVESCREEN keyword.
		 Define BASE2BIN routine and associated variables for
		   FCN_SAVESCREEN.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	 Define FLOWERCASE routine for BASE2BIN.

SWAT_COM.INC	 Define PLSTBUF_STR structure for PLSTBUF.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define FCN_SAVESCREEN routine.

SWAT_FMT.INC	 New include file for @DEC_xxx equates.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Convert NLSTBUF from ABS to WORD.
		 Convert PLSTBUF_TAB from table of ptrs to
		   ptr to table of ptrs (PPLSTBUF_TAB).
		 Initialize PPLSTBUF_TAB in SETUP once and only once.
		 Include size of PPLSTBUF_TAB in uninitialized data.
		 Include size of last screen buffers in uninitialized
		   data.

SWAT_LC2.INC	 Define bit to mark whether or not PPLSTBUF_TAB has
		 been initialized.

P87_DISP.ASM	 Move @DEC_xxx equates into SWAT_FMT.INC and include
		   that file.

MAKEFILE	 Mark dependency of SWAT.ASM and P87_DISP.ASM on
		 SWAT_FMT.INC.

386SWAT 	 Include SAVESCREEN=nnn keyword.

386SWAT.DOC	 Document SAVESCREEN=nnn keyword.

QMAX_IN2.ASM	 Fix bug in setting MOVE_TAB limit if it exceeds 1MB.
		 In fact, the value that was used (PRGSIZE) was larger
		 than necessary as we don't actually move that amount.
		 Instead, we now set the limit to the amount actually
		 moved based upon ZLDATA.
