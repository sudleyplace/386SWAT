Add GP Skip Keyword For INT Instruction

When intruding into other memory manager's PL0 context (coming to a
TWT near you soon), I've found it helpful to GP Skip the INT
instruction.  As silly as it sounds, some MMs (EMM386 from MS) set the
DPL in the IDT of many interrupts to zero such that they generate a GP
Fault when executed from VM (a PL3 context).  This change adds the INT
instruction to the list of ones you may wish to skip but still get the
benefit of trapping other GP Faults.

At the same time, I added the keyword ALL to skip all such GP Fault
instructions so we don't have to change our profiles each time a new
instruction to skip comes along.

386SWAT 	 Define new GPSKIP keywords.
		 Use consistent format for secondary lines.

SWAT_GPS.INC	 Define new flag bit.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define new keywords in parse table.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 In CHECK_GPS, check for INT instruction.
