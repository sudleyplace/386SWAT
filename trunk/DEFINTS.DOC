Change Default Interrupt Behavior

Originally, SWAT was designed to work in conjunction with other
debuggers (partially because SWAT wasn't as fully featured as the
commercial ones).  To this end, the INT 01h/03h traps were not set by
default so they wouldn't interfere with the other debugger.

This behavior actually puts SWAT at a disadvantage because if the SWAT
user forgets to enable those interrupts (as is the case if they don't
read the documentation which says to copy 386SWAT to *.PRO and use it
on the SWAT command line), they think SWAT isn't working.

This TWT changes the default behavior to always enable INT 01h and 03h
at startup.

Also, included in this TWT are the following changes:

* Remove support for INT 11h (Alignment Check).  It's never used and
  sometimes gets in the way.

* Include support for Segment Not Present Fault (INT 0Bh) with a
  profile keyword (TRAPSEGNP), and other corresponding changes.


386SWAT 	 Remove TRAPACHK support.
		 Include TRAPSEGNP support.
		 Reword others to reflect Fault nature.

SWAT_ARG.INC	 Replace ACHK with SEGNP flag.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Remove TRAPACHK support.
		 Include TRAPSEGNP support.
		 Make TRAPSTEP and TRAPSKIP the default.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	 Reword INT 0Bh comments to reflect dual nature
		   (interrupt vs. fault) although SEGNP can't occur
		   in RM.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Remove TRAPACHK support.
		 Include TRAPSEGNP support.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Remove TRAPACHK support.
