Implement Commands to Trace From VM To PM

Based upon a suggestion from a beta tester, two new keyboard commands
are implemented (Ctrl-Padplus and Ctl-F11) which behave like the
non-Ctl forms except when the current instruction is an INT xx or INTO
in VM.	In the latter case, the effect is to trace from VM to PM,
unless the CPU doesn't ordinarily go there.  This can happen on a CPU
for which VME is in effect and for which this interrupt is not trapped
in PM.	In this case, we trace the INT into VM just as the non-Ctl
form would do.

The following modules are changed and why:

386SWAT.DOC	 Document new keyboard commands.

SWAT_LC4.INC	 Define new flag for Ctl-Tracing.

SWAT.ASM	 Define actions for new commands.
		 Minor cleanup at SWATTER_TRACEARPL and
		   SWATTER_TRACEINTFF.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	 Document new keyboard commands.
