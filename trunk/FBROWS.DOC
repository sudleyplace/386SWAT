Design for file browser:

SYM_FNAME[0] determines whether buffer contents are valid or not.

FBROWS_FPTR is the offset within file of the beginning of buffer
FBROWS_FLEN is the number of bytes in buffer which are valid

FBROWS_BUFOFF is the word offset of the buffer (must be near addressable).
FBROWS_BUFLEN is the word buffer length in bytes.

*_SLINE is the screen start in lines from beginning of file
*_CLINE is the highlighted line       "
*_NUMLINES is the number of lines to display (22)
*_SOFF is the word offset within DGROUP of last SLINE displayed.
*_COFF is the word offset within DGROUP of CLINE (used for display only).

ADJUST_CLINE takes a signed argument in AX which is added to CLINE.
If the new CLINE is out of the current screen range, begin
  Count lines from SOFF
  If the current line begins within range of valid buffer contents, begin
    If it ends within range, begin
	Save offset as COFF
	Seek back or forwards to set new SOFF, and adjust SLINE
    end else (not in range) if not EOF (FBROWS_FLEN <> FBROWS_BUFLEN) and
    not BOF (FBROWS_FPTR == 0), begin
	If DOS busy, display message and truncate, else begin
	    Seek to new FBROWS_FPTR such that FBROWS_BUFLEN/2 bytes maximum
	    will be read into buffer.
	    Move existing buffer data into place.
	    Read file data in to form a contiguous block.
	    Adjust FBROWS_FPTR and FBROWS_FLEN.
	end.
    end else (not in file) truncate.
  end else (not in buffer) if not (EOF or BOF), begin
	If DOS busy, display message and truncate, else begin
	    Seek to new FBROWS_FPTR such that FBROWS_BUFLEN/2 bytes maximum
	    will be read into buffer.
	    Move existing buffer data into place.
	    Read file data in to form a contiguous block.
	    Adjust FBROWS_FPTR and FBROWS_FLEN.
	end.
  end else (not in file) truncate.
end else (in screen range) adjust CLINE.  Find new COFF.

When displaying file contents, we check first for the validity of the
buffer.  If SYM_FNAME[0] != 0, it's valid; display the name, FBROWS_CLINE
and (FBROWS_COFF - FBROWS_BUFOFF + FBROWS_FPTR), and continue.

Starting at FBROWS_SOFF, we display lines, continuing until
1. <current location> - FBROWS_BUFOFF > FBROWS_FLEN (EOF/truncated)
2. FBROWS_NUMLINES (22) lines have been displayed

We count line numbers within the file starting from FBROWS_SOFF.  If we
match FBROWS_COFF, display line highlighted.

-----------------------------------------------

Down arrow, page down, and LI n adjust FBROWS_SLINE.  Symbol references
set FBROWS_CLINE and force FBROWS_SLINE to be readjusted by adding 0 to it.
