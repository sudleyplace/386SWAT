Change MAKEFILE to Support Creation of New Directory

This change to MAKEFILE allows one to create a new directory easily by
calling the batch file NEWDIR.BAT, just as was done for 386MAX.

To create a new TWT directory, first define a SET statement in your
environment for TWTEXT (e.g., Set TWTEXT=BOB).	Typically, this
statement should be placed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Next, type

P:\386SWAT\NEWDIR dirname [oem [flags]]

where DIRNAME is the name (without extension) of the directory to be
created locally as well as in P:\TWT using the extension found in
TWTEXT (e.g., BOB).  OEM is an optional subdirectory name (default =
BCF) to be created on the local drive.	FLAGS are optional flags to be
passed to NMAKE.  This batch file copies all files necessary to start
a TWT onto your local hard disk.

MAKEFILE is changed as follows:

* A new variable NEWDIR is defined (default value N) to control
  whether or not we execute MASM or copy .OBJ files.  This variable is
  set to Y in the NEWDIR batch file to create a new TWT directory.

* The variable $(NEWDIR) is tested in appropriate places to be
  sensitive to whether or not we're creating a TWT directory.

* New pseudo-target NEWDIR is created if NEWDIR=Y is specified on the
  command line.  This target is used to copy auxiliary files to the
  local TWT directory.

This change affects MAKEFILE and NEWDIR.BAT.
