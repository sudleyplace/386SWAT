Allow unassemble of physical addresses

The unassemble command is extended to allow an optional trailing P and
further optional value for CR3 in a manner identical to the way we
allow data display of physical addresses.  The new unassemble command
syntax is

Ux opt_addr		x î {<empty>, 16, 32}
Ux addr P		x î {<empty>, 16, 32}
Ux addr P atom		x î {<empty>, 16, 32}

At the same time, a bug in page up of instructions is fixed.

386SWAT.GRM	 Note support of Ux with physical translation.

SWAT.ASM	 In GET_LASTILEN, handle physical unassemble.
		 In GET_LASTPLEN, fix bug in reference to EBP on the
		   stack.
		 In GET_LASTPLEN, handle physical unassemble.
		 In SET_CURINSTR, clear @MODE_PHYS flag.

SWAT_BLK.ASM	 Define PHYOFF as place to display "PHYSICAL via CR3"
		   message if appropriate.
		 Save value for PHYOFF.
		 In DISP_BLK4, handle physical unassemble.
		 In DISP_BLK4, display "PHYSICAL via CR3" message.

SWAT_MEM.ASM	 In HDR_PHYS, strip out display code to subroutine.
		 Define HDR_PHYS_SUB to do the actual display,
		   callable from DISP_BLK4.

SWAT_UNA.ASM	 Define UNACR3 as CR3 to use in physical memory
		   translation.
		 In CMD_UNASM, parse physical address translation
		   command line.
