Fix Two Bugs in VIDPTE.BOB

Two bugs crept into the VIDPTE.BOB changes:

* The variable SWATDATA isn't initialized before it is used in
  SET_VIDPTE.  This causes SWAT to fail whenever the previous value of
  this variable is different from what the current one should be.  In
  particular, shifting modes (e.g., MAX to VCPI) or shifting from
  paging disabled (the initial state) to paging enabled where SWAT
  resides in memory which is not one-to-one linear to physical can
  exacerbate this bug.	This change affects SWAT_FVM.ASM only.

* When the LDT_VID selector was deleted from the LDT structure in
  SWAT_VCP.ASM, a constant value wasn't updated.  This change affects
  SWAT_VCP.ASM only.

* At the same time, I noticed that the stack in SWAT is not
  dword-aligned; now it is.  This change affects SWAT.ASM only.
