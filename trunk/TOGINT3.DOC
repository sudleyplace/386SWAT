Swap Out Local IDT Entries Around TOGINT Call

When SWAT is active, it hooks various interrupts for its own use such
as the timer, keyboard, cascade, and mouse (the latter two in case
there's a PS/2-style mouse which goes through the keyboard
controller).

When we toggle an interrupt via command line (TOGINT xx xx ...), or
keystroke (Alt-F1, etc.), we need to swap out our local entries around
the toggle so that we save the new entry in the proper (global)
location.  In particular, this affects TOGINT 0A which is hooked
locally.

SWAT_TOG.ASM	In ACT_TOGINT, call REST_IRQS at the start and
		  SAVE_IRQS at the beginning of the routine.
