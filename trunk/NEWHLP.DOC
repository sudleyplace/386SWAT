Implement Help Menu Topics

In a manner similar to that used in RAMExam (and a shameless ripoff of
that code, if I must say so), SWAT now has help menu topics.

The help text is all contained in an overlay segment WTXT (rather than
define a whole new overlay class, it's easier to use one of the
existing Windows overlay segments).  If the feature is requested
before the overlay has been loaded an error message is displayed
instead ("Feature Not Initialized").

If any new help topics are defined, the phrase NEW TOPIC GOES HERE
identifies each place where a change should be made.

Miscellaneous changes:

* Fix a bug in Windows handling of bookmarks where we failed to
  distinguish between PM and VM.

MAKEFILE	 Define new environment variable RXMDIR which points
		   to the RAMExam directory where we expect to find
		   WRAPPER.COM and WRAPPER.INC.
		 Define new entries for SWAT_HTX.ASM.

SWAT.ASM	 Delete call to GETKEY after DISP_HELP as that's now
		   handled in the later routine.

SWAT_AGR.ASM	 Distinguish between PM and VM bookmarks when under
		   WIndows.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	 Define new error message for uninitialized features.

SWAT_HLP.ASM	 Define new help handling.  This code is an alomst
		   complete ripoff of the code from MEM_HELP.ASM.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	 Define new help topic text.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Define new help screen attributes.
		 In INIT_VIRT where an overlay is being read in and
		   loaded upstairs, change the point at which the file
		   is closed and preserve BX in case any new overlays
		   are added later on.	I originally had a new overlay
		   section for help text, but then decided it wasn't
		   necessary.  Nonetheless, I though that this change
		   (which was necessary for a new overlay section) was
		   useful to leave in.

SWAT_WIN.ASM	 Define new window display routines for displaying
		   help text.  See MEM_SCRN.ASM for the original
		   code.
