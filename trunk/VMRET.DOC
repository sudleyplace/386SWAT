Add .VM addresses for Windows debugging

Especially when debugging calls from a Windows app down to
a VM interrupt handler, it is sometimes useful to know where
we'll come back to in Windows on the other side of the ARPL
wall.  .VMRET will often work if the call was made via DPMI
SIMVMI (function 0300) or an INT instruction emulated by the
DPMI host (Windows).
