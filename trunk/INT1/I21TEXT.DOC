Include Function-Specific Text in INT 21h Comments

Becasue they occur so often in code, the display of INT 21h
instructions which are the current instruction now includes
function-specific text (e.g., "Write File (handle)").

This is a completion of an old TWT of Mark Alexander's.

INT1_FNS.ASM	 In @INTMSG, check for INT 21h instructions as the
		   current instruction.

INT1_WIN.ASM	 Include DOS function-specific text.
