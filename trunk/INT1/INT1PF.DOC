Handle Page Faults When Unassembling

Previously, if we attempted to unassemble at a linear address which
was not present in memory, SWAT went poof.  This can happen most
easily when debugging under Windows due to a typing mistake at the
command line.  With this change, the disassembly code installs a Page
Fault handler which, if triggered, puts in a disassembly of ????  for
one byte.  That way, the disassembly screen shows one-byte opcodes
(which display as ??) and ????	as the instruction disassembly.

INT1_FNS.ASM	 Define data varibales to handle re-entrancy issues.
		 Define install and restore routines for the Page
		   Fault handler.
		 Define Page Fault handler which cleans up the stack,
		   puts in the appropriate display data, and jumps to
		   a common exit point.
		 Document return register from INSTR_OPER_COM.
		 At the start of INSTR_OPER_COM, save re-entrancy data
		   variables on the stack and install the Page Fault
		   handler.
		 At the end of INSTR_OPER_COM, restore the original
		   Page Fault handler, and pop off re-entrancy
		   variables.
		 Remove extraneous <> around STOS target.
