Miscellaneous P5 Related Changes

Some instructions new with the P5 use new opcodes as well as some need
special handling.  In particular, the following changes are included
in this TWT:

* Although this isn't specifically P5-related, it turns out that SLDT,
  STR, and SMSW are sensitive to the Operand Size Prefix (OSP).  The
  documentation for these instructions says otherwise, but the true
  arbiter is the CPU.  If an OSP is present with SLDT and STR, those
  instructions zero-extend the value being stored to 32-bits and store
  into the (now) 32-bit target.  If an OSP is present with SMSW, the
  entire contents of CR0 are stored into the (now) 32-bit target.
  This means that we should decode the target of these instructions as
  a dword memory or R32 if OSP is present.  The technique used is to
  define a secondary OSP flag which is set in the GRP6-7 processing
  code if the 32-bit target is to be used.  The pseudo-code in
  INT1_ESC.ASM tests for the secondary OSP flag instead of the primary
  OSP flag.  This change affects INT1_FNS.INC, INT1_TAB.INC,
  INT1_ESC.ASM, INT1_FNS.ASM, and INT1_GRP.ASM.

* Previously, we disassembled the instructions whose opcodes are 0F 30
  and 0F 32 as SLC0 and SLC1 because we had encountered them on an IBM
  386 SLC CPU, but we didn't really know what they did.  After reading
  the P5 spec, I found that they are opcodes to read and write
  Model-Specific Registers.  Consequently, the disassembly of these
  instructions is now RDMSR and WRMSR.	This change affects
  INT1_ESC.ASM and INT1_TXT.ASM.

* Other P5-specific instructions such as RDTSC, CPUID, and CMPXCHG8B
  are also disassembled as appropriate.  Note that we need to define
  action RM64 for CMPXCHG8B as its destination is a qword.  This
  change affects INT1_TAB.INC, INT1_ESC.ASM, INT1_FNS.ASM, and
  INT1_TXT.ASM.

* The opcode 0F FF signals an Invalid Opcode.  It also is used by
  Windows to switch control from PM PL3 to PL0.  Consequently, we
  disassemble it as WIN06 just so it can be recognized more easily
  when it occurs.  This change affects INT1_ESC.ASM and INT1_TXT.ASM.

The following modules are changed and why:

INT1_FNS.INC	 Define new flag for secondary OSPs.

INT1_TAB.INC	 Define macros for IFOSP2, ELSEOSP2, and RM64.

INT1_ESC.ASM	 Make GRP6 and GRP7 instructions sensitive to
		   secondary OSP flag.
		 Define disassembly action for WRMSR, RDTSC, RDMSR,
		   CPUID, CMPXCHG8B, and WIN06.

INT1_FNS.ASM	 Define actions for IFOSP2, ELSEOSP2, and RM64.

INT1_GRP.ASM	 If primary OSP is present and the GRP6 opcode is SLDT
		    or STR, set secondary OSP flag.
		 If primary OSP is present and the GRP7 opcode is
		    SMSW, set secondary OSP flag.

INT1_TXT.ASM	 Define text macro for new and/or changed
		   instructions.
