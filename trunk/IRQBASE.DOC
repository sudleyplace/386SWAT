Read IRQ Bases If VCPI Client

If we're running as a VCPI client, we should read and use the IRQ base
of the VCPI host.  I didn't think any memory manager would be so
foolish as to use a base of other than 08h and 70h, but then along
comes DRDOS 7 (DRDOS 6 uses the original bases).  Boy, are they asking
for trouble.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	 In CHECK_VCPI, read and save for later use the master
		   and slave IRQ bases.
