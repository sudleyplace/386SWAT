Avoid TF After POPF

If we trace over a PUSHF or PUSHFD, the CPU puts a flag (d)word onto
the stack with TF set.	The subsequent POPF then causes an INT 01h
after the next instruction whether or not we traced the POPF.  This
change avoids that problem by recognizing PUSHF and PUSHFD and
skipping over them (planting an INT 03h) instead of tracing them.

SWAT.ASM	 At SWATTER_TRACE, check for PUSHF and PUSHFD and
		   convert a trace into a skip.
