Fix Bug With DEBUG=PMI And Device SWAT

If we're loading as Device SWAT at startup, INIT_PROT is called at the
point where SWAT is a temporary VCPI client of the MM.	Thus the
active IDT is that of the VCPI client and INIT_PROT is setting up the
MM's IDT where the VCPI client has calculated the IDT's linear address
in the VCPI client's linear address space.

All this is background to say that we can't signal an INT 01h if
DEBUG=PMI is specified because the active IDT (that of the VCPI
client) does not have its IDT entries setup for debugging unless
there's a preceding SWAT in the picture.  This changes enforces that
condition.

SWAT_INI.ASM	In INIT_PROT, don't signal an INT 01h if DEBUG=PMI is
		  specified if we're Device SWAT without a preceding
		  SWAT.
