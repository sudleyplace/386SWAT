Allow Physical Display Without Paging

Even if paging isn't enabled, it's convenient to allow display and
unassembly of physical data via a specified CR3, particuarly under
Windows.  With a few minor tweaks, this is possible.

SWAT_DAT.ASM	 Delete code which disallows this feature when
		   displaying data via D command.

SWAT_MEM.ASM	 In DISPPHYS, handle case where paging isn't enabled.
		 Convert some 16-bit code to 32-bit (CX->ECX,
		   LOOPS->LOOP).
		 In DISPVIRT (inverse to DISPPHYS), handle case where
		   paging isn't enabled.

SWAT_UNA.ASM	 Delete code which disallows this feature when
		   unassembling code via U command.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 In LIN2PPTE, LIN2PPDIR, and LIN2PPTEZ (inverse to
		   the preceding two routines), handle case where
		   paging isn't enabled.
