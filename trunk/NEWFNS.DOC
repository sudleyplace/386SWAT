* Implement AND (&) and XOR (^) functions for command line.
* Define case-sensitive and case-insensitive get token routines.
* Change special GDT, IDT, LDT names to .GDT, .IDT, .LDT to avoid
  conflict with symbols.
* Implement .TSS to return base of current TSS as effective address.
* Implement .CODE and .DATA to return base of code and data displays
  as an effective address.
* Implement |T as monadic function to extract CS|EIP as effective
  address from (presumed) TSS effective address.
* Fix bug in parser returning incorrect message (syntax instead of
  overflow) in PARSE_ADDR.
