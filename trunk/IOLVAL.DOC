Parse I/O Command line Instructions as LVALs

For greater generality, the command line I/O instructions now allow an
LVAL instead of just an atom.  Also, the IMR command line action
displays the original values not the ones set by SWAT.

386SWAT.DOC	 Note change to I/O command line of atom to VAL.

386SWAT.GRM	 Note changes to I/O command line of atom to LVAL.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	 Note change to I/O command line of atom to VAL.

SWAT_IOP.ASM	 In INPUT_ACTIMR, return master and slave PIC values
		   active outside SWAT, not the ones SWAT sets up.
		 Change all PARSE_ATOMs to PARSE_LVAL.
