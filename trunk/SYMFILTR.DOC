Filter Leading Text From Symbols

Some symbols, especially from Windows programs written in C, are
prefaced with text such as "__imp__", "_", and the like which adds the
symbol's length but not understanding.  This feature allows you to
specify in the SWAT profile leading text which is to be stripped from
each symbol.

SYMFILTER = text1 [text2 [...]]

The default settings are

SYMFILTER=__imp__ _

Up to 128 characters can be specified in this way.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	Include SYMFILTER in parse table.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	Define action to profile keyword.

SWAT_SYM.ASM	Strip leading text from symbols.
