Avoid Spurious Interrupt On Certain Systems

It appears from talking with Intel that some 8259s are flaky and can
generate a spurious interrupt (IRQ7) even if that IRQ is masked off in
the Interrupt Mask Register.  This means that on such systems, an IRQ7
can be generated while SWAT is active and be passed on down to 386MAX
as SWAT didn't expect it to occur and has no handler at the ready.
This change puts on additional body armor to cover this hardware bug.

The following modules are changed and why:

SWAT_INT.INC	 Define equates for IRQ7 intercept.

SWAT_DTE.ASM	 Save and restore SWAT's local IRQ7 handler around
		   the IDT display.

SWAT_KEY.ASM	 Define save areas for INT 0Fh handler.
		 Intercept INT 0Fh handler while SWAT is active.
		 Restore original INT 0Fh handler when SWAT exits.
