Enable entries in Software Interrupt Redirection Bitmap
Enable Delete function in APPKEY keystroke buffer editor

These changes parallel changes to 386MAX in recognizing
chips that don't support Virtual Mode Extensions.  We also
turn on IDT trapping of interrupts we may need via the
SIRB.

Some other minor changes are included as well.

Files affected:

MAKEFILE	Get rid of $Log$ text.	It's all available via VLOG.

		Lose .PSS rules; they're rarely used, if at all.

SWAT.ASM	Use BTR instead of TEST / AND.

SWAT.WSG	Specify new selector values.

SWAT_DBG.ASM	Use laundered feature bits to check for I/O breakpoints.

SWAT_ENT.ASM	Implement e addr valist.

SWAT_INI.ASM	Launder CPU feature bits for steppings that say they
		support VME but don't do it properly.

SWAT_LC2.INC	Free defunct @LC2_P5 flag for future use.

SWAT_REM.ASM	Implement keystroke buffer deletion.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	If VME present and enabled, make sure we set bits in SIRB.
