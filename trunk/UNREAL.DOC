UNREAL Command

Implement UNREAL command to allow debugging of Unreal Mode.  This mode
is a variant of Real Mode in which segment registers (CS, DS, ES, FS,
GS, or SS) can access all of the 4GB address space.  That is, instead
of the normal 64KB length of a segment, the length is 4GB.  This
command can enable all or just some of the registers for Unreal Mode.
See SWATCMD.HTM for more details.
