Reduce Erroneous Selection of IRET in ROM

When we are asked to trace an INT instruction in VM, we need to find
an IRET instruction (which we look for in the system ROM) in order to
trace over it to set the TF at the first instruction in the interrupt
handler.

When we search for the IRET in system ROM, we used to search from
F000:0 upwards, however, we might be fooled if 386MAX has recovered
the address space at F000:0 and we happen to also find an IRET in the
recovered memory.  This change searches from the top of the system ROM
downwards in order to avoid that problem.

Also, the order in which the TF is set in the return flags is changed
to avoid generating a spurious INT 01h upon return from the interrupt
handler.

SWAT.ASM	 At SWATTER_TRACEINTFF, use shorter instruction.
		 At SWATTER_INT1, search from top to bottom for IRET
		   in system ROM.
		 At SWATTER_INT_XIRET, set TF after saving return
		   flags on VM stack to avoid spurious INT 01h upon
		   return.
