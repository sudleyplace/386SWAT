Fix Bugs When Line Numbers Off

If we're running with line number display disabled (LI-), we still can
display line numbers for Jcc/JMP/CALL targets.	Also, with LI- in
effect and when scrolling the screen, if the last line would have a
line number on it (even though they're not displayed), the last line
is left blank.	Both these bugs are fixed by checking for line number
display off and the matching label being a line number.

SWAT_SYM.ASM	 In SYMHASH_SRCH, if we're not to display line
		   numbers, and the matching record is a line number,
		   continue searching.
