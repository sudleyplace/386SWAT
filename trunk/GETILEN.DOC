Fix Bug In GETILEN

When I changed SWAT over to USE32, I missed a routine (GETILEN) which
calculates the length of an instruction.  That routine assumed that
the D-bit in the code segment which contains the instruction is clear.
Of course, it's now set for SWAT.  This change tests for the D-bit and
operates appropriately.  At the same time, I widened that routine's
input and output registers all to 32-bits.

SWAT_OPR.ASM	 Make sensitive to D-bit in code segment.
		 Widen input and output registers to 32-bits.
