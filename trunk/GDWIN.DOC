Set the GD Bit In DR7

Because some programs get a kick out of resetting the debug registers
which we've carefully setup, this change has SWAT automatically set
the Global Debug (GD) bit in DR7 on startup so that we can stop such
programs before they can do any harm.  Perhaps it doesn't surprise you
that Windows is the chief reason for this feature.

The profile keyword NOGD negates this behavior in case there's a
problem.

MAKEFILE	Note dependency of SWAT_FCN.ASM on SWAT_LC4.INC.

386SWAT 	Document new keyword.

SWAT_LC4.INC	Define bit for new keyword.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	Include new keyword in parse table.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	Define action routine for new keyword.

SWAT_INI.ASM	In INIT_PROT, set GD bit in DR7 unless asked not to
		  (NOGD), or it's already set.
