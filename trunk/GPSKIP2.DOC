Implement More keywords For GPSKIP

Two additional instructions which can generate GP Faults are included
in the list of ones we may wish to skip:  IN from an immediate I/O
port and IN from the I/O port in DX.  For example, these might be used
on a MicroChannel system with I/O port 92h (which MAX traps).

The following modules are changed and why:

386SWAT 	 Document additional optional parameters to GPSKIP
		   keyword.

SWAT_GPS.INC	 Define additional flag bits.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define additional instruction names.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 Delete unneeded code to set SIRB entries for Pentium
		   systems (MAX does this now).
		 In our GPSKIP handler, check for additional
		   instructions.
