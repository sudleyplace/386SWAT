Implement Time Stamp Counter Display

On CPUs which support it (TSC bit set in CR4), display the # clocks
executed since the last time SWAT was entered.	There is a certain
amount of overhead in each entry to SWAT, so the numbers displayed
will never be at the level of single instruction clock counts, but it
is a good measure of time over a longer set of instructions.

Also, in SWATTER, the DRn tests are made table driven.


SWAT.ASM	Make DRn tests table driven.
		Save old TSC value before exiting from SWATTER.

SWAT_BLK.ASM	Re-organize data to be better aligned.
		Define display message for TSC.
		Save/restore register around use in DISP_BLK1.
		Displat TSC after BLK1.

SWAT_INI.ASM	Initialize TSC in INIT_PROT.

SWAT_INT.ASM	Save new TSC on entry to each interrupt handler.
		In INT 01h and 03h handlers, clear high-order word of
		  ESP and EBP before use if 16-bit stack.

SWAT_TSC.INC	Define macro for TSC use.
