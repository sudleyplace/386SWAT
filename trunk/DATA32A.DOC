Convert Data Segment to USE32, Part A

As we're nearing the 64KB limit of a USE16 data segment, drastic
measures are required.	This is the first of many such TWTs the
ultimate goal of which is to convert all SWAT PM data to USE32
segments.  At that point, who knows what LINKer bugs we'll run into
(remember the problems when converting SWAT's code to USE32?), but
we'll be better off trying.  Subsequently, I'll do this module by
module.

Principally, I need to move the BIN2xxxx procedures to use ES:EDI
instead of ES:DI, so that's a large focus of this TWT.  More to
follow.

There's also some miscellaneous stuff included:

* Correct errors and update old conventions in 386SWAT.DOC.

* In CMD_CHAR in SWAT_CMD.ASM, set ESI to point to the command line so
  all command line routines can reference the command line via ESI.


386SWAT.DOC	 Correct errors and update old conventions.

SWAT.ASM	 Update input to BIN2xxx to use EDI instead of DI.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	 Set ESI instead of SI before calling any command line
		   function.
		 In ENDOF_CMDLINE, return EDI instead of DI.

SWAT_DBG.ASM	 Update input to BIN2xxx to use EDI instead of DI.

SWAT_DTE.ASM	 Update input to BIN2xxx to use EDI instead of DI.

SWAT_ENT.ASM	 Update input to BIN2xxx to use EDI instead of DI.

SWAT_FBR.ASM	 Delete unreferenced items.
