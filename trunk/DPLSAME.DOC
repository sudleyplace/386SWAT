Use Same DPL When Hooking Interrupts

Some memory managers (pssst, it's EMM386) set the DPL of various
entries in the IDT to zero expecting the CPU to signal a GP Fault if
the corresponding software interrupt occurs.  When we intrude into
their PL0 context, previously we were setting the DPL to three because
we didn't expect to encounter a MM which had a fetish with GP Faults.
Now we retain the same DPL as the original IDT entry except for INTs
01h and 03h.  They are handled differently so we can issue the
corresponding software interrupts and gain control immediately instead
of having to hook the GP Fault handler and pick them off there.


SWAT_COM.INC	 Make the IDTMAC macro sensitive to preserving the
		   original IDT entry's DPL except for INTs 01h and
		   03h.
