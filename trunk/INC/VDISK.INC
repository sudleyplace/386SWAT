;to conform to the DOS standard for boot records.

	 dw	 0		; Number of hidden sectors

; The following word is the 16-bit kilobyte address of the first byte in
; extended memory that is not occupied by a VDISK buffer
; It is placed into this location so that other users of extended memory
; may find where all the VDISKs end.

; This field may be accessed by moving the boot record of the First extended
; memory VDISK from absolute location 10 0000H.  Before assuming that the
; value below is valid, the vendor ID (constant VDISK) should be verified
; to make sure that SOME VDISK has been installed.

; For example, if two VDISKs are installed, one 320KB and one 64KB, the
; address calculations are as follows:

; Extended memory start address  = 100000H (1024KB)
; Start addr of 1st VDISK buffer = 100000H (1024KB)
; Length of 1st VDISK buffer	 = 050000H ( 320KB)
; End addr of 1st VDISK buffer	 = 14FFFFH
; Start addr of 2nd VDISK buffer = 150000H (1344KB)
; Length of 2nd VDISK buffer	 = 010000H (  64KB)
; End addr of 2nd VDISK buffer	 = 15FFFFH
; First byte after all VDISKs	 = 160000H (1408KB)
; Divide by 1024		 =   0580H (1408D)

; Content of BOOT_EM		 =   0580H

VDISK_NEXT dw	 1024		; KB addr of first free byte of extended memory
