Fix Bug When Searching For Bytes

In an earlier TWT, when handling Page Faults, the ZF flag was cleared
without realizing that subsequent code depended upon it being set.
The effect was that searches for bytes were never found.  This change
fixes that.

SWAT_SRC.ASM	Ensure ZF=1 on byte searches.
