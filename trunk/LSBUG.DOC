Fix bug in SWAT LS command

If the LS command is used when PL0 DPMI services are not enabled,
SWAT will generally hang on a GP fault within MAX.  It is also
possible for the system to run out of file handles, since this
bug causes the file referenced by LS not to be closed.

The .XBDA and .XBDA2 commands generate effective addresses for
the XBDA and the secondary XBDA formed by (XBDA+[XBDA:B4):0.

The ] operator is added as a byte extract, similar to [ for word
extract and { for dword extract.

Files affected:

SWAT_CMD.ASM	Add error message for missing XBDA segment at 40:E.

		Add .XBDA and .XBDA2 symbols.

		Handle byte extraction.

		Add procedure to skip expressions or tokens.

SWAT_SYM.ASM	Add optional postfix sign operator to description
		in comment.

		Strip out postfix operator so as not to confuse parser.
		We also continue to handle postfix operators separated
		from the segment expression by white space.

		Fix bug where we try to free handle -1 and don't free
		valid handles.
