Enter/Exit Protected Mode Example

This assembler program was written to provide an example of how to
enter and exit Protected Mode (PM) under various starting points one
might encounter in DOS:

* Real Mode (RM);

* Virtual Mode (VM) using VCPI;

* Virtual Mode (VM) using DPMI.




VCPI:

To simplify stack references, we set the B-bit in the stack selector
so we can use ESP for base addressing as necessary.


DPMI:

We enter PM as a 32-bit client.  This has several implications among
which are

* Interrupts are passed to us with a 32-bit stack frame, and we
  terminate using IRETD or RETFD as appropriate.

* DPMI calls made by us must use 32-bit register pointers (ES:EDI
  instead of ES:DI) where appropriate.

* The B-bit in the stack selector so we can use ESP for base
  addressing.
