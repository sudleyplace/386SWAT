Use Monochrome Adapter If Present

Rather than switch to the mono adapter every time I startup the
system, I thought it easier to implement a keyword to do the same.
With this keyword (MONO) present, if a monochrome adapter is present
in the system, it becomes the initial display screen for SWAT.

386SWAT 	 Document the new keyword.

386SWAT.DOC	 Document the new keyword.

SWAT_LCL.INC	 Define a bit for the new keyword.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Define an entry in the parse table.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define the action routine for the new keyword.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 If both adapters and the new keyword are present, use
		   the monochrome adapter as the initial display
		   screen.
