Support International Keyboards

One of SWAT's design goals is to be as unassuming about the system as
possible, intruding into the system at an absolute minimum.  As part
of achieving this goal, SWAT has its own keyboard handler so it can
debug keyboard actions within the BIOS as well as not depend upon the
system's keyboard routines or data being intact and functional.

One consequence of this is that SWAT needs to be changed in order to
support international keyboards which is what this TWT accomplishes.

To this end, the keyword KEYB= is recognized in the SWAT profile.  At
the start, the only keyboard supported is the German one -- its
keyboard layout is 129, so the KEYB= value is GR129.  Others can be
supported as the need arises.

New keyboard layouts go in a new module SWAT_KT2.ASM.

Also, the German keyboard uses the right Alt-key as a modifier for
certain other keys.  This has two effects:  we need to add more
entries in the shift key precedence table for both Alt-keys, and we
need to add one more column in the TABMAC tables for the other
Alt-key.


386SWAT 	 Note additional default keyword value.
		 Document new keyword.

386SWAT.DOC	 Document new keyword.

MAKEFILE	 Include new module in .OBJ list.

SWAT_SEG.INC	 Define new byte-wide segment in class 'ndata'.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Define parse table entry for new keyword.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define structures and macros for additional keyboard
		   tables.
		 Define keyboard table entries.  Until we need to, the
		   other layouts are documented but commented out.
		 Define action routine for new keyword.

SWAT_KEY.ASM	 Define additional precedence entries as we now
		   distinguish the left and right Alt-keys from each
		   other.
		 Include bits for both Alt-keys when indexing the
		   shift precedence table.
		 Index TABMAC tables by five words instead of four
		   words to reflect the additional column for the
		   other Alt-key.

SWAT_KT2.ASM	 New module to contain layouts for international
		   keyboards.
