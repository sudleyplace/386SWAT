Fix Bug In Physical Display/Unassemble In Device SWAT

If paging isn't enabled (all through device SWAT, and through start of
386MAX initialization), if one displays data or disassembles
instructions using physical translation (e.g., D F000:0 P), SWAT
misbehaves.  This corrects that problem.

At the same time, I changed the grammar for the D and U commands to
accept an expression after the physical translation marker instead of
just an atom (which is limited to a constant or register) so it can be
more general.  For example, when debugging VCPI programs, when a mode
switch from VM to PM is requested, ESI contains the linear address of
the Enter PM structrue whose first dword is the incoming CR3.  It is
convenient to display data or disassemble instructions in the VCPI
context using a physical translation of "P {0|ESI" rather than have to
remember and type in the actual incoming CR3 value.

The following modules are changed and why:

386SWAT.GRM	 Note new grammar for D and U commands.

SWAT_DAT.ASM	 Document and change the grammar for D command.
		 When doing physical translation, if paging isn't
		   enabled, turn off physical translation flag (it's
		   one-to-one anyway).

SWAT_UNA.ASM	 Document and change the grammar for U command.
		 When doing physical translation, if paging isn't
		   enabled, turn off physical translation flag (it's
		   one-to-one anyway).
