Implement Show PTE Command

Strolling through a large set of Page Tables such as under Windows can
be tiresome, hence there's a new command.  The SPTE command works
exactly likely the PTE command (displaying the Linear address/PDE/PTE
on the command line) as well as displaying the corresponding PTE (as
if you had pressed F5 and scrolled down to the appropriate entry).

At the same time, I allowed Ctrl-Up and -Down to scroll through the
PDEs/PTEs one entry at a time (Up and Down scroll through one line at
a time).

386SWAT.DOC	Document previously omitted keystrokes.
		Document new command.
		Document previously omitted dot keywords.

386SWAT.GRM	Document new command.
		Document previously omitted dot keywords.

MAKEFILE	Note dependency of SWAT_PTE.ASM on SWAT_COM.INC.

SWAT.ASM	Allow Ctrl-Up and -Down on display of PDEs and PTEs.
		Ensure PTE_START/PDE_START not negative by more than a
		  line's worth.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	Include SPTE command in parse table.

SWAT_DTE.ASM	In DISP_PTE and DISP_PDE allow display on single
		  PDE/PTE boundary.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	Document new command.

SWAT_PTE.ASM	Define routine for SPTE command.
