Allow trace over task switch.

When we trace through an INT in PM or far JMP/CALL in PM which
performs a task switch, we must handle it specially in order to retain
control (and stop at the next instruction).  The several cases that
can occur as are follows:

1.  INT in PM via Task Gate:  set the debug bit in the TSS.

2.  INT in PM via Trap/Interrupt Gate:	put INT 3 at start of
    execution in the interrupt handler.

3.  Trace over ARPL in VM:  handle as case 1 or 2 above with INT 06h.

4.  Far JMP/CALL via TSS or Task gate:	handle as case 1 above.

In each case, if we set the debug bit in the TSS, be sure to clear the
trap flag in the caller's flags so that the EFL saved into the current
TSS at the time of the task switch has TF clear.  That way, we won't
automatically trace the second instruction upon returning to the
current TSS.

Another small feature is added in this TWT:  the install/restore Page
Fault handler now saves and restores the original value of CR2 (the
Page Fault linear address).  That way, we don't change that register
if we're asked to display something which generates a Page Fault.
