
P:\TWT\SWAT\WIN67.WRL				10 June 1992

The changes in this TWT are intended to make 386SWAT more useful within
Windows.  Less whitespace is used when disassembling the WIN386 INT 20h
dynalink comments.  This allows more significance in the service name.
VxD services new to Windows 3.1 have been added.  WIN386 does not support
INT 67h calls from ring-0.  Therefore, the SWATVXD must use a FAR CALL scheme
to access the symbol services within 386SWAT.LOD.  The SWATINFO structure
has a new field containing the offset to SWAT's LCL_INT67 procedure.
This field is filled in by the INT 67h AX=DEF1h handler in SWAT_VCP.ASM.
For this to work, changes are required in SWATVXD.  These have been in place
for months.
