Include Bound Interrupt (INT 05h) in List of VCPI Interrupts

Along with many other interrupts, we now have the ability to trap
Bound Interrupts (INT 05h) when debugging on the other side of the
VCPI wall.  At the same time, I fixed a bug in the VCPI 486 Alignment
Check (INT 11h) interrupt handler.  It had previously and mistakenly
assumed that it could use the common code at TSS_INTCOM.  However,
that code should be used for only those exceptions which can overlay
hardware interrupts (typically 08h-0Fh).

This change affects SWAT_VCP.ASM and 386SWAT.
