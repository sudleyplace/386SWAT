Fix SYMSIZE Bug

Previously, I had attempted to calculate SYMSIZE based upon the size
of the incoming .SSF file and it didn't work.  This time it does.  The
effect is that you don't need to use SYMSIZE with a LOADSYM, thus
reducing wasted space in SWAT's symbol table as well as perhaps
avoiding a mistake when calculating SYMSIZE and finding it is too
small.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Catch the exit case when reading in the .SSF file.
		 Add into the SYMSIZE calculation room for the
		   difference between the storage and incoming strucs
		   per symbol.
