This changes INT1_WIN.ASM to include WINDEVID.INC and use the define for
the SWATVXD device ID.

It also changes INT1_FNS.ASM to mask off the high-order bit of the Windows
DYNALINK function code.  This bit controls the JMP versus CALL operation of
the INT 20h.  Before this change, SWAT declared those with the high bit set
to be unknown functions.
