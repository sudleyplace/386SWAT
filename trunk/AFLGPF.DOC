AutoFault for GP Faults

The Autofault facility has been extended to GP Faults.	This means
that an attempt is made to interpret each GP Fault intercepted by SWAT
in a short sentence.  Type Shift-F4 to see the last Autofault error
message.  Because GP Faults are many and varied, some case will be
missed (marked as unknown) or mistaken.  Please notify the author as
you encounter such cases with the exact circumstances of the GP Fault
so they may be corrected.

SWAT_AFL.ASM	For TSS Faults, split out RM case as unknown.
		For TSS Faults, split out VM vs PM cases.
		For GP Faults, split cases based upon the instruction.
