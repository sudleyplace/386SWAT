Shrink The Low DOS Memory Load Size

As SWAT gets bigger and bigger, it spans an ever growing range of low
DOS memory during its initialization.  Recently, when debugging in a
DOS 7.0 (Chicago) context, there is even less low DOS memory available
for device drivers as the transient CONFIG.SYS code is larger.

This change attempts to address that problem, at least in part, by
introducing the concept of overlays.  In particular, WGROUP in SWAT
consists of all static data which can be loaded later on in the
initialization phase, specifically during INIT_VIRT.

The changes to effect this are as follows:

* Move all of WGROUP to the end of 386SWAT.LOD so that the EXE header
  can be reduced to a point below it and thus DOS won't load that
  portion into memory during the 4B03h call.

* If we're loaded as a device driver, relocate INIT_VIRT code to a
  point just above RGROUP so there's plenty of low DOS memory in which
  to load WGROUP.

* Define new INT 67h debugging function to transfer data from low DOS
  memory to extended memory.


Note that the same technique can be applied to the video and DVGA
tables when needed.


The following modules are changed and why:

386SWAT:

MAKEFILE	 Call FIXOVL after LINK to delete the overlays from
		   the file size in the EXE header.

VCPI.INC	 Define new INT 67h function to transfer data.

SWAT_LCL.INC	 Define bit to determine whether or not WINTAB is
		   present in memory.

SWAT_SEG.INC	 Move WGROUP segment to the end of the file.
		 Change alignment type on WDATAZ to para so we can
		   find it more easily in the file.

SWAT_OVL.INC	 Define new include file to map the overlay structure.

SWAT.ASM	 Move WDATAZ segment from here to INT1_WIN.ASM (and
		   rename DTAIL to WTAIL).

SWAT_DRV.ASM	 Relocate the INIT_VIRT code to lower memory (just
		   above the relocated RGROUP) so we have plenty of
		   low DOS memory to read in WGROUP.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Change alignment type on WDATAZ to para so we can
		   find it more easily in the file.
		 Rename DTAIL to WTAIL to better reflect its
		   parentage.
		 Define XFILPTR to hold local XGROUP copy of FILPTR.
		 In INIT_VIRT, open the .LOD file, read in the EXE
		   header, move the file pointer to the WINTAB
		   overlay, read it into memory, and pass it up to
		   SWAT in extended memory.
		 In INIT_REAL, copy contents of FILPTR to XFILPTR for
		   use within INIT_VIRT.
		 In INIT_REAL, use the address following XGROUP as the
		   start of dynamic data.
		 In INIT_RERAL, count in the size of WINTAB as it's no
		   longer part of initial data.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 Define handler for new transfer data function.


INT1:

MAKEFILE	 Move target files (.OBJ, .MAP, .ARF) to subdirectory
		   RET.
		 Define missing dependency in INT1_FNS.ASM on
		   QMAX_FIL.INC.
		 Define dependency in INT1_FNS.ASM on SWAT_LCL.INC.
		 Define dependency in INT1_WIN.ASM on SWAT_OVL.INC.

INT1_FNS.ASM	 Before using WINTAB, ensure it's present.

INT1_WIN.ASM	 Define overlay structure in WDATAZ for WGROUP.


FIXOVL:

FIXOVL.ASM	 Define module to fix the EXE header for files which
		   conform to the SWAT overlay structure.
