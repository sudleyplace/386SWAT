Ignore Invalid Opcode From VM If Caused By BSWAP

Because some VM programs attempt to execute the 486-only BSWAP
instruction to detect if they are running on a 486, we need to ignore
it if SWAT is trapping Invalid Opcodes (INT 06h) via TRAPINV.  This is
a nicety to avoid bringing up SWAT when running Lotus 1-2-3 version
3.10 (one of the culprits).

SWAT_INT.ASM	 Rewrite INT 06h interrupt handler to detect this
		   case.

386.INC 	 Insert if @WordSize where necessary to allow the
		   macro to work in both USE16 and USE32 cases.
		 Define new macros PUSHW, POPW, and POPD.

OPCODES.INC	 Define equates for high and low opcodes for BSWAP.
