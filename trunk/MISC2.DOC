Miscellaneous Changes

1.  Display appropriate comment on DPMI interrupt lines.  This also
    involves defining a new segment to hold the DPMI function values
    (as words).

2.  For display of PTEs, note the PDE which contains the top line of
    the display as well as the range of linear addresses covered by
    the top line.

3.  For display of PDEs, note the range of linear addresses covered by
    the top line.

4.  Display display of PTEs and PDEs, handle not present entries by
    displaying "????????".

5.  Change the initial mask for memory display to allow 32-bit values.

6.  Change the number of entries displayed in dword format to eight by
    squeezing the entries together.  Note that the previous width can
    be obtained via the dd/4 command.

7.  Save the previous d?/?? value for later use separately for each
    width.

8.  If the selector passed to any routine which calls GETARWBASE is
    not present, return with CF=1 to indicate an error.  This change
    is needed by WINSWAT to avoid displaying an incorrect label for
    not present selectors.  As it turns out, without this change and
    with the new KRNL386, USER, GDI symbol display in WINSWAT the
    label displayed for not present selectors is that of the Windows
    routine BOZOSLIVEHERE.

9.


SWAT_SEG.INC	Define new segment to hold word values for WINBASE
		  tables.

SWAT_DAT.ASM	Change MEMCNT from dword to array of dwords so we can
		  save a separate value for each width.

SWAT_DTE.ASM	For display of PTEs, note the PDE which contains the
		  top line of the display as well as the range of
		  linear addresses covered by the top line.
		For display of PDEs, note the range of linear
		  addresses covered by the top line.

SWAT_MEM.ASM	Change the initial mask for memory display to allow
		  32-bit values.
		Change MEMCNT from dword to array of dwords so we can
		  save a separate value for each width.
		Change the number of entries displayed in dword format
		  to eight by squeezing the entries together.  Note
		  that the previous width can be obtained via the dd/4
		  command.
		Delete code to save new width into MEMCNT as we now
		  use the previous value.
		Define routine to get and display a dword.

SWAT_MSC.ASM	If the selector passed to any routine which calls
		  GETARWBASE is not present, return with CF=1 to
		  indicate an error.

SWAT_SCR.ASM	When displaying PTEs and PDEs, handle not present
		  entries by displaying "????????".
		Define routine to display an ASCIIZ line of a specific
		  length.

INT1_WIN.INC	Define additional pointer to table of word values.

INT1_FNS.ASM	In @PTR16@16 and @PTR16@32, save the selector and
		  offset for later use.
		In @INTMSG, display appropriate comment for DPMI
		  interrupt functions.

INT1_WIN.ASM	Expand strucs to include table of word values
		  (functions) for comment lines.
		Delete extraneous WINMAC entries in INTER21 as the
		  code which checks the function # against the table
		  length will catch this.
		Define DPMI function call table entries.
