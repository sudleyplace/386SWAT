Implement VMSINT= Command

In order to better support VCPI debugging, a new syntax to an old
command line keyword is defined to enable the user to change the set
of interrupts hooked whenever SWAT intrudes into a VCPI context.

386SWAT.GRM	 Define new command (as well some old ones).

SWAT_HTX.ASM	 Document new command.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 (This printout has the changes from the DEFINTS TWT
		  merged into it).
		 In CMD_VMSCOUNT, use U32_HEX2DD instead of BASE2BIN.
		 In CMD_VMSINT, document and define new syntax.
