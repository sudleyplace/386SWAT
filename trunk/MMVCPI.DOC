Miscellaneous VCPI-related Changes

* Fix a bug when debugging VCPI apps when loading as a device
  driver (we're either a RM, VCPI (MM w/o INTRUDE), or PL0 (MM
  w/INTRUDE) debugger).  Because SWAT's PTEs are not necessarily in
  the VCPI page tables (they are by construction with 386MAX, but not
  with other MMs), we need to take special action to ensure that this
  is the case, otherwise we can't debug VCPI apps.  In particular, we
  intercept VCPI DE01 calls, pass it on to the MM and fill in our own
  PTEs when the MM has filled in its own.

* When SWAT is called during INIT_VIRT, if the variable SWATDATA has
  not been filled in, the overlay data is not copied to the correct
  place.  In general, we need to call SETUP on any entry to SWAT which
  doesn't go to SWATTER as we might be depending upon variables first
  initialized in SETUP.  A new flag is defined to indicate whether or
  not SETUP has been run.

* To make the VCPI fill PTE call easier to use, the meaning of the
  return value in ECX is changed from the # PTEs actually filled in
  (possibly fewer than than the number specified) to the # PTEs which
  remain to be filled in.  This way, a program can inquire as to how
  many PTEs are required by SWAT by calling it with ECX=0.

* The INT 67h handler in SWAT_VCP.ASM has been cleaned up
  considerably.  Because so many subfunctions to INT 67h setup the
  stack to address FORW_STR as well as set DS to DGROUP, we do this on
  entry for all subfunctions.  Also, because we can't trust the
  caller's stack selector (particularly when we're intruding), some of
  (but not all) the dependencies on the high-order word of ESP being
  valid are removed.


MAKEFILE	 Note dependency of SWAT_VCP.ASM on SWAT_LC4.INC.

SWAT_DRV.INC	 Define VCPI fill PTE flag.

SWAT_LC4.INC	 Define SETUP has been run flag.

VCPI.INC	 Change meaning of @VCPI_FILLPTE value.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	 When loading as device driver, mark as needing to
		   append our PTEs to the end of a VCPI DE01 call.
		 Change comment on meaning of return value from
		   @VCPI_FILLPTE.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 In REST_PROT, mark as SETUP has not been run.
		 In SETUP, mark as having been run.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 In LCL_INT67, setup SS:EBP ==> FORW_STR on entry.
		 In LCL_INT67, if SETUP hasn't been run before, do so.
		 In LCL_INT67, handle trailing DE01 fill in of SWAT's
		   PTEs.
		 In fill PTE call, change meaning of return value.
		 Put fill PTE code into subroutine for multiple calls.
