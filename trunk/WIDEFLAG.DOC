Widen Flags Words To Dwords

To accommodate growth, certain flag words are widened to dwords.  The
flags changed are LCL_FLAG, LC2_FLAG, LC4_FLAG, and TRP_FLAG.  Mostly,
the only item changed in a file is the EXTRN declaration, but
sometimes a flag is moved into a register and that register is
widened, or a flag is pushed onto the stack, etc.

The following files are affected in similar ways:

INT1_FNS.ASM
SWAT.ASM
SWAT_AFL.ASM
SWAT_ARG.ASM
SWAT_BLK.ASM
SWAT_CMD.ASM
SWAT_COM.INC
