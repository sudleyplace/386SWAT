Fix Bug In PATH= Profile Routine

When converting over to USE32 data, I missed a place where I should
have cleared the high-order word of a 32-bit register.

Also, in the process of debugging this problem, I put in several more
STROUT messages.

SWAT_DRV.INC	 Move STROUT macro from SWAT_DRV.ASM to a common
		   include file.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	 Define new message text.
		 Move STROUT macro from SWAT_DRV.ASM to a common
		   include file.
		 Display more debugging messages.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 In FCN_PATH, widen register argument to U16_PATH_COM.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Display more debugging messages.
