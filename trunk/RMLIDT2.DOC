Delete RM IDT From Resident Data If NORMLIDT

If we're loading as device SWAT and NORMLIDT is in effect, we don't
need to save the 1KB taken up by our local copy of the RM IDT.	This
change moves the RM IDT to the end of the resident code/data in RGROUP
and uses a variable (PRTAIL) to hold the ending offset.  This variable
is set to a lower offset if NORMLIDT is in effect.

This change affects SWAT_DRV.ASM only.
