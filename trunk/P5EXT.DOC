P5 Related Changes

The following changes related to P5 support are included in this TWT:

* Detect whether or not we're running on a P5.

* Display the Software Interrupt Redirection Bitmap (SIRB) in the TSS
  display.  This portion is displayed only if we're on a P5 and the
  $VME bit in CR4 is set.

* Support Breakpoint on I/O via the BD command with either an "I" or
  "O" qualifier (the two are functionally identical) as in
  "BD addr L1 I".  There must be no segment/selector specified (as it
  makes no sense).  If BD I/O specified and we're on a P5, enable the
  debugging extensions in CR4.

* Define record elements for new P5 bits.

Other changes made at the same time include:

* Define record elements for arbitrary bits by number.

* Allow the U command to specify a Task Gate, Call gate, or a TSS and
  translate it to the corresponding CS|EIP via a common routine
  (already defined elsewhere).


The following files are changed and why:

386.INC 	 Define new P5 bits.

SWAT_LC2.INC	 Define new P5 present bit.
		 Reorganize equates to use mask values instead of
		   constants.

MAKEFILE	 Note dependency of SWAT_DTE.ASM on SWAT_LC2.INC.

SWAT_DBG.ASM	 Define new equate for BD ... I or O.
		 Define display text for BD I/O.
		 Check for "I" or "O" qualifier if it's a P5 and no
		   selector/segment specified.
		 If BD I/O, set CR4.DE.
		 If BD I/O, don't display selector/segment field.

SWAT_DTE.ASM	 Define header line for SIRB.
		 Display SIRB if we're on a P5 and the $VME bit in CR4
		   is set.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Determine whether or not we're on a P5.
		 Define routine to determine whether or not the CPU
		   supports the CPUID instruction.
		 Define routine to determine whether or not we're on a
		   P5.

SWAT_REG.ASM	 Delete old record elements for $CE and $WT (early
		   design of 486 which was changed before production
		   release).
		 Define record for bits in CR4.
		 Define new record elements for P5 bits in EFL.
		 Define new record elements for P5 bits in PTEs.
		 Define record for arbitrary bit values by number.
		 In SETREG_CR0, if the CPU is a 486 or later and we
		   just set the $NW bit in CR0, execute WBINVD.

SWAT_UNA.ASM	 Convert the Sel|Off from the command line to CS|EIP
		   through common routine which handles Task Gates,
		   Call Gates, and TSSs.
