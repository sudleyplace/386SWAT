* Don't allow the IO Permission Bit Map to scroll out of range

While displaying a TSS, Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down will scroll through the
IO Permission Bit Map.

I have placed an edge condition on Ctrl-Up, so we will not wrap when
scrolling past line 0.
Also, when the user scrolls to the bottom, the last line is saved, so
that the user will not roll-over back to line 0.
