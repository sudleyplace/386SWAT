Skip Over Read/Write From/To Debug Registers If GD Bit Is Set

When the GD bit in DR7 is set, any read from or write to a debug
register triggers a Debug Fault (and the CPU clears the GD bit from
DR7 so the Debug Fault handler can use those registers).

Various environments (Microsoft Windows comes to mind) clear the debug
registers upon entry thus making it difficult debug that context.
With this change, setting the GD bit traps reads and write of those
registers and handles them transparently.  A read from a debug
register returns the actual value.  A write to a debug register is
ignored.  The GD bit can be set from the SWAT command line via

R DR7.GD=1

If you desire this behavior to be the default, use SWATCMD with the
above argument.

The following files are changed and why:

SWAT.ASM	Handle additional entry points which we must allow to
		  proceed.

SWAT_DBG.ASM	Define labels around an entry point.

SWAT_INT.ASM	Define table of action routines for reading a debug
		  register.
		In LCL_INT01, check for and handle GD debug faults.
		In LCL_INT09, don't read BIOS data area if we're in W
		  as that location might not be mapped in.
