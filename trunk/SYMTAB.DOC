Display symbol table TWT

These changes to SWAT include
 - Added Ctrl-F6 (Display symbol table) screen to SWAT
 - Fixed symbol search.  Because we were calling GET_TOKN to read
   symbol names from the command line, and because GET_TOKN rejects
   anything not A-Z or 0-9, symbols never got found and generated
   a 'Syntax error' message in SWAT.
 - Rearranging SWAT's project management to conform to the new model.
   There is currently only one OEM version of SWAT, which goes in RET.

Files affected:
386swat.prj	New file - project description file for 386SWAT

makefile	Changes are currently logged out and are relative to
		the current PVCS code base.  This makefile now supports
		the new project management model, with all generated
		files going in the RET directory.  Also compressed out
		space between MASM option switches and comma-separated
		arguments; long pathnames for LST caused NMAKE/MASM to
		choke.

swat.asm	Added support for Ctrl-F6.  Added processing of up, down,
		PgUp & PgDn while in display symbol table screen.
		Changes are relative to code in p:\twt\swat\symbols.bob
		and need to be merged.

swat_cmd.asm	Added GET_SYMTOKN to get symbol names as tokens from
		the command line.  This accepts all characters up to
		the next tab, space or null.  Used a call to GET_SYMTOKN
		before trying to find the token in the symbol table.
		Changes are relative to code in p:\twt\swat\symbols.bob
		and need to be merged.

swat_hlp.asm	Added Ctrl-F6 to help screen.  Changes are logged out
		relative to the current PVCS code base.

swat_com.inc	Added state equate for displaying symbol table.  Changes
		are logged out relative to the current PVCS code base.

swat_sym.asm	Added DISP_SYMTAB (invoked by Ctrl-F6) & it's associated
		variables.  Changes are relative to code in ...\symbols.bob
		and need to be merged.

swat_sym.inc	Added additional bitmap values for symbol flag (as defined
		in p:\misc\swttools\MAPSSF.H).	Changes are relative to code
		in p:\twt\swat\symbols.bob and need to be merged.
