Fix Bug When Using TSS For Faults

A previous TWT changed a local routine to be more self-sufficient by
setting DS within the routine instead of relying upon the caller to
set this register.  Alas, that was a mistake as in some cases we rely
upon the Invisible Descriptor Cache, particularly when we're accessing
selector values in the caller's LDT.  This TWT fixes that to use two
routines, one which assumes the global DS has been set, one which
does not.

At the same time, I fixed a problem with device SWAT where software
INTs 01h, 02h, 03h, and 68h are not being enabled if VME is.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	Enable appropriate software INTs if VME is enabled.
		Use SEL2BASE_DS where DS is already set to AGROUP.
		Change routine SEL2BASE to call SEL2BASE_DS.
		Define routine SEL2BASE_DS to obtain selector base
		  assuming DS addresses AGROUP.
