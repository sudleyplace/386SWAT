Add Color To SWAT Help Screen DIsplays

In order to improve the SWAT help topic display, a color attribute is
available.  This color attribute applies to the entire line, not
within a line (gimme a break).	The text in SWAT_HTX.ASM contains
references to the COLOR macro which specify the color index number
(not the color itself).  The actual color depends upon the video mode
(B&W, LCD, or color) and is defined in SWAT_INI.ASM.  Each line in the
help topic text is preceded by a color index number (with zero being
the default color).  Unless a file contains a reference to the COLOR
macro, no extra color index number is included in the output, thus not
affecting RAMEXAM.

WRAPPER.INC	 Define new COLOR macro.

WRAPPER.C	 Define variables to handle color attributes.
		 Handle color switch.
		 When outputting a line, if we're using colors,
		   include the color index number.
		 Whenotuputting the row count equate, if we're using
		   colors, include the color index number in the
		   column count.

MEM_HTX2.AUS	 Delete two leading ESCs in $Header$ line.

SWAT_HLP.ASM	 When skipping over leading rows, include the color
		   index number in the column count.
		 When displaying a help text topic, display the lines
		   one by one with the appropriate color attribute.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	 Include COLOR macro as appropriate.
		 Note that we use an LALR parser on the command line.
		 Reorganize the Quick Guide to Keystrokes to space it
		   out more.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Define array of additional color attributes which
		   correspond to the color index numbers.
