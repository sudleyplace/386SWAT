Implement VMSINT Toggle Command

Because some VCPI programs choke when VMSINT is enabled, it's helpful
to turn this feature on and off selectively.  Need I say more?

SWAT_CMD.ASM	 Define command line actions.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	 Document new command.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 Define action routine for new command.
