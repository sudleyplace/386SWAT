Handle Invalid Symbol Selectors

If we upload symbols with an invalid selector (say, the *.WSG file is
for another context -- DPMI vs. VCPI vs. RM), the call to GETBASE
returns an error along with EAX=-1.  If this value is used for the
linear address, the symbol is marked as invalid and the address hash
code gets confused.  This change checks for the above eventuality and
sets the pseudo-linear address to zero to avoid this problem.  BTW,
the symptom is that (say) SWATRUN hangs when uploading symbols if it
has two or more symbols with the same (invalid) linear address, e.g.
300|0.

At the same time, I upgraded the grammar for LS and PS to accept lvals
instead of just atoms, thus allowing a wider variety of ways of
specifying the arguments to these commands.  Others in this same vein
to follow.

386SWAT.GRM	 Note upgraded grammar.

SWAT_SYM.ASM	 Upgrade parsing of atoms to lvals.
		 In UPDATE_ADDRHASH, handle invalid selector.
