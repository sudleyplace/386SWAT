Fix Bug in LOADSYM Keyword

Because of a parsing error in FCN_LOADSYM, if the LOADSYM keyword is
not followed by =filename.ext, any following switches are ignored.
This change allows LOADSYM and /H to work together.

Also, a minor change to the overall parsing corrects a problem in
which we did not allow a /switch to immediately follow a keyword.
This change allows LOADSYM/H to be parsed correctly.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Allow slash as valid keyword terminator.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 In FCN_LOADSYM, if no =filename.ext, check for
		   switches anyway.
