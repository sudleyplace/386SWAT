As a convenience in debugging in a DOS environment, the symbol .DMAC
is defined to mean the segment and offset of the start of the DOS
memory allocation chain.  That way, one can use DB .DMAC to display
the first such entry, and then skip to the next one from there.

The information saved in INIT_REAL is that of the linear address of
the list of lists in case we need information from that table later
on.
