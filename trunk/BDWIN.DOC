Re-enable Debug Register Linear Address

When we use BDn+, it's possible that the linear address has been
overwritten especially if we've gone into and out of Windows which
zeroes the debug registers upon termination.  This change resets the
linear address at BDn+ time.

SWAT_DBG.ASM	 In CMD_BDENA, reset the linear address into the
		   appropriate debug register.
