Allocate SWAT's Local Stack As Unintialized Data

In a never-ending attempt to reduce the low DOS memory footprint of
SWAT, it occurred to me that the 1KB local stack switched to by SWAT
each time it gains control could just as well be in uninitialized data
rather than in static data.

As we all know, nothing is that simple, so a few other changes were
required:

* Because the stack offset might be above 64KB, we must ensure that
  the B-bit in our data selector is set so the CPU uses ESP for
  implicit stack references.

* Some stack references using BP were changed to use EBP.

The following modules are changed and why:

SWAT.ASM	 Delete declaration of LCLSTK.
		 Define label at start of SWAT to avoid silly LINKer
		   message about there being no starting address.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Ensure that the B-bit is set in our data selector in
		   the GDT.
		 Save the offset of the top of the stack in
		   uninitialized data for later use.

SWAT_WIN.ASM	 Change stack references from BP to EBP.
