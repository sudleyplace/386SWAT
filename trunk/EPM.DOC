In Device SWAT, Use EPM Code Exclusively To Enter PM

In case device SWAT runs into broken BIOSes or other INT 15h hookers
(such as the Kingston Datacard) which do not correctly handle INT 15h
function 89h, we use our EPM code as the only way to enter PM.
Previously, we used the BIOS function the first time we enter PM.
However, we need to rely upon our own EPM code at each subsequent
entry (such as when tracing), so why not use it exclusively.

This change affects SWAT_DRV.ASM only.
