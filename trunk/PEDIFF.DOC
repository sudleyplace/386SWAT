Fix Bug In Device SWAT PE Bit Difference

With device SWAT we clear PE bit if the VM bit is set as we're not
really in PM.  In DISP_BLK3 when we display CR0 (and whether or not it
changed from the last time) we mistakenly tested the VM bit in a copy
of CR0, but of course the VM bit is in EFL.  This TWT fixes that.

SWAT_BLK.ASM	 In DISP_BLK3, test VM bit in EFL, not CR0.
