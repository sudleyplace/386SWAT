Split Apart Toggling of INT 01h and INT 03h

In order to simplify debugging of 386SWAT itself, this change splits
apart interception of INTs 01h and 03h.

* New keywords TRAPSTEP and TRAPSKIP are defined to intercept INTs 01h
  and 03h separately.

* Change meaning of c-F1 to toggle INT 01h only.

* Change meaning of c-F2 to toggle INT 03h only.

* Change meaning of c-F3 to toggle INT 06h.

* Undefine C-F4.  The previous meanings of c-F1 through c-F4 were
  related to the 486 cache.  To accomplish the same effect, use the
  register commands R CR0.CD=0 or 1, and R CR0.NW=0 or 1.

The following files are modified and why:

386SWAT 	 Make minor changes to existing keywords.
		 Make TRAPNMI a default when using this profile.
		 Define new keywords.

SWAT_ARG.INC	 Replace @ARG_DEBUG with @ARG_STEP and @ARG_SKIP.

SWAT_LC3.INC	 Define equates for new flag word.

MAKEFILE	 Note dependency of SWAT.ASM on SWAT_LC3.INC
		 Note dependency of SWAT_INI.ASM on SWAT_LC3.INC
		 Note dependency of SWAT_SCR.ASM on SWAT_LC3.INC

SWAT.ASM	 Define new flag word LC3_FLAG.
		 Change meaning of c-F1 to toggle INT 01h only.
		 Change meaning of c-F2 to toggle INT 03h only.
		 Change meaning of c-F3 to toggle INT 06h only.
		 Undefine c-F4.
		 Define new entry SWATTER_I01A to mark that we should
		   toggle INT 03h also.
		 Change the code at SWATTER_I01 to toggle INT 01h
		   only.
		 At the end of SWATTER_I01, check to see if should
		   toggle INT 03h also (we entered at SWATTER_I01A).
		 Define separate actions to toggle INTs 03h and 06h at
		   SWATTER_I03 and SWATTER_I06.
		 Delete code to toggle 486 cache state.
		 Move the "Last screen -xxx" message to the left so it
		   doesn't overlap the toggle state displays.
		 *** This is what the changes actually do, although
		   you might not be able to detect that by reading the
		   VDIFF listing.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Change action for TRAPDEBUG to set both TRAPSTEP
		   and TRAPSKIP flags.
		 Define new actions to handle TRAPSKIP and TRAPSTEP.

SWAT_HLP.ASM	 Document new keystroke meanings.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Separately initialize INT 01h and 03h.
		 Note initialization of INT 06h in LC3_FLAG as it's
		   now able to be toggled.
		 Separately uninitialize INT 01h and 03h.

SWAT_SCR.ASM	 Provide separate displays of the state of INT 01h,
		   03h, and 06h hooks.
