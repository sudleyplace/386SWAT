Allow Search Command Of PTEs

When tracking down a bug in Win95, I found it useful to extend the
search command to search through the PTEs for a specific value.  The
new syntax is

S  addr addr   # PTE
S  addr L expr # PTE

where PTE can be any expression.

At the same time, I fixed a bug where a Page Fault during the display
of the searched for data caused a crash.

386SWAT.DOC	Document new syntax.

386SWAT.GRM	Document new syntax.

SWAT_MOD.INC	Define new bit for PTE searching.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	Document new syntax.

SWAT_OPR.ASM	When returning from a trapped Page Fault, ensure that
		  ZF=1 in case the Page fault occurs on a REPNE
		  operation.

SWAT_SRC.ASM	Change default SRC?MODE and SRC?MASK to PM with full
		  4GB range.
		Define variables for searching PTEs.
		Use PARSE_EXPR instead of PARSE_ATOM as appropriate
		  for greater generality.
		Document new syntax.
		Defer offset vs. mask checks to later so as to avoid
		  them for PTE searching.
		Define actions for PTE searching.
