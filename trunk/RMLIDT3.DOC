Make NORMLIDT The Default

I've encountered enough circumstances debugging RM where RM LIDT
redirection has gotten in the way, that I've decided that it's best to
make NORMLIDT the default and use the (new) keyword RMLIDT to enable
it when necessary.

386SWAT 	 Document keyword changes.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Define parsing entry for new keyword.
		 Make NORMLIDT the default.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define function entry for new keyword.
