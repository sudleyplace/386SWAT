Prepare For WINSWAT

* A feature needed by WINSWAT is the ability to set a temporary
  breakpoint from a Windows program.  This requires that we fill in
  the rest of the fields where else this feature is used.

* A feature needed by WINSWAT is the ability to refresh debug hooks
  when a selector's linear address changes.

* The assumption that DS=AGROUP in SEL2BASE became sufficiently
  annoying that I removed it by setting DS within the routine.	At the
  same time, to improve stack alignment, the argument to SEL2BASE is
  widened from a word to a dword.


MAKEFILE	Note dependency of SWAT_VCP.ASM on SWAT_CMD.INC.

SWAT.ASM	Fill in additional SIGINT_xxx fields for temporary
		  breakpoints.
		Fill in additional BREAKPT_xxx fields for temporary
		  breakpoints.

SWAT_DBG.ASM	Define routine REFRESH_DEBUG to refresh BC and BD
		  values.

SWAT_INT.ASM	Widen argument passed to SEL2BASE from word to dword.

SWAT_SIG.ASM	Define additional SIGINT_xxx fields and set them as
		  appropriate.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	Remove setting DS to AGROUP around call to SEL2BASE.
		Widen argument to SEL2BASE from word to dword.
		Define two additional @DBGSYM_xxx functions to refresh
		  debug hooks and to set a temporary breakpoint.
