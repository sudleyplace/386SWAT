Implement Command Recall

Commands entered on the command line are saved in a ring buffer whose
length can be changed from the default of 1024 via the profile keyword
CMDHIST=nnn.

Previous commands can be retrieved via the keystrokes Alt-< (previous
command) and Alt-> (next command).  Pressing either of these keys
repeatedly scrolls through the buffer in the chosen direction.	The
keystroke Alt-? displays a history of (up to 25) commands from which
a command can be chosen by scrolling up or down through the list, or
by typing the letter next to the command.  A command may be deleted
from this list via the Del key.

Also included in this TWT are the following:

* A bug was fixed when running under Windows where a jump was taken
  with the wrong sense (JZ vs.	JNZ) if Win386 services are available.

* A new help screen to describe the various searching options is
  defined.
