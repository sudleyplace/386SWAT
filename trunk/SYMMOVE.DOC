Fix Bug When Moving Symbols to Extended Memory

Some BIOSes require that the BIOS-reserved fields used in a BIOS block
move be initialized to zero.  When we move symbols to extended memory
(via the LOADSYM= command), we allocate room for the BIOS block move
DTE on the stack where the data might be zero.	This chaneg fixes
that.

This change affects SWAT_FCN.ASM only.
