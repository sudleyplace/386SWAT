RBdualVGA v0.92 	 Copyright 1996 Ralf Brown

[Note: this documentation is very preliminary, and the software is a
       pre-release version]

What is RBdualVGA?  It is a set of programs which permit the use of two
color SuperVGA displays on a single PC (which is ordinarily not supported).

System Requirements
===================

     DOS 3.0 or higher
     DESQview 2.26 or higher (if using DESQview)
     TWO PCI-bus SuperVGA cards; they should be as similar as possible
     1100 bytes memory for TSR

	  INITDUAL.SYS	     initialize second monitor at boot time
          DUALVGA.COM        screen blanker and switcher TSR
          MONITOR2.COM       run specified program on second monitor
	  DO-PIF.DVP	     sample DESQview .DVP
	  DO-SCRIP.SCR	     sample DESQview Learn script


Installation
============

  1. Add INITDUAL to your CONFIG.SYS by inserting a line like
	   DEVICE=C:\INITDUAL.SYS
     This DEVICE= line should be as early in CONFIG.SYS as possible, and
     *must* precede any memory manager which remaps ROMs (i.e. QEMM with
     Stealth enabled).	If you are using DOSMAX or QEMM's DOS-UP, the call
     to INITDUAL should follow the DOSDATA.SYS line to avoid being
     executed twice.

     INITDUAL.EXE runs as a device driver, but does not remain resident, and
     therefore does not consume any memory.

     A sample CONFIG.SYS fragment:
	      DEVICE=C:\QEMM\DOSDATA.SYS
	      DEVICE=C:\BOOT\INITDUAL.SYS
	      DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS RAM ST:M XBDA:H R:1 DMA=64 SRBP:N
	      device=c:\qemm\dos-up.sys @c:\qemm\dos-up.dat
	      DEVICE=C:\BOOT\XMSDISK.SYS 2560K
	      ...
	      SHELL=C:\4DOS\4DOS.COM C:\4DOS @C:\4DOS\4DOS.INI /P

  2. Add DUALVGA to your AUTOEXEC.BAT by inserting a line like
	    DUALVGA I 2 12 15 20
     This command installs the screen blanker and switcher TSR and tells
     it to blank the screen after two minutes of inactivity, then select
     the DPMS power modes "standby", "suspend", and "off" after 12, 15,
     and 20 minutes, respectively.  The monitor which is active at the
     time DUALVGA is installed becomes the primary monitor, and the other
     monitor becomes the secondary monitor.  Which monitor is active at
     boot time depends on the order in which your system's BIOS scans
     adapters; if the monitor which you wish to be the primary monitor
     is not active at boot time, you will need to rearrange your video
     cards.

     Once DUALVGA has been installed, you may switch the active display
     at any time by pressing RightShift-RightCtrl-F12.	You may also
     cause an immediate switch into low-power mode by pressing
     RightShift-RightCtrl-F11; on pressing this keystroke, both
     screens are immediately blanked and then placed into VESA "off"
     mode a second later; unblanking is disabled for three seconds to
     give you time to release the keys.

  3. Add MONITOR2 to batch files and DESQview .DVP files as appropriate.
     Simply precede any line in a batch file which is to execute on the
     secondary monitor with MONITOR2, i.e.
	       MONITOR2 edit foo.bar
     For a DESQview .DVP, set the program to execute to MONITOR2.COM, and
     set the program arguments to the actual program and arguments you
     wish to execute on the secondary monitor.	For example,
	       Program...: c:\dv\monitor2.com
	       Parameters: c:\4dos\4dos.com
     You may also want to add the startup script from DO-SCRIP.SCR to the
     Learn scripts for the DESQview .DVP is you normally run your screen
     at other than 80x25, since running MONITOR2 tends to reset the screen
     to that mode.


Limitations
===========

   DUALVGA assumes that a single copy of the video BIOS can drive either
   video board, so both boards need to use the same chipset, and otherwise
   be as nearly identical as possible.


Known Problems
==============

   MONITOR2 v0.9 is not able to intercept DESQview's cursor emulation in
   graphical modes (30-line or 60-line text display on the Rearrange/Video
   Options menu).  The result is occasional disruption of graphics or even
   text fonts on the secondary monitor, and sporadic cursor remnants on
   the primary monitor if the program on the secondary display is running
   in the background.  Neither problem appears when the primary monitor
   is in a true text mode, a graphical program is running full-screen
   on the primary monitor, or the secondary display's program is suspended
   (i.e. in the background when background execution is turned off).

   Full source code will be included when v1.0 is released.
