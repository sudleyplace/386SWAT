Make INTRUDE The Default Option

Now that INTRUDE is reasonably well debugged, I'm making it the
default option so users don't need to remember to use it (which has
happened several times).  This will reduce the number of tech support
questions I get from users of SWAT on the Internet.  In case the user
needs to use the VCPI client version of SWAT, the disabling option
VCPISWAT is defined.


386SWAT 	 Define new headers for each section:  Recommended,
		   Default, and All options.
		 In the All Options section, precede every line with a
		   semicolon so it's easier to distinguish which lines
		   are active and which ones are inactive.
		 Document new disabling option, VCPISWAT.

386SWAT.DOC	 Document VCPISWAT keyword.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Define new keyword VCPISWAT.
		 Minor changes to comments.
		 Call FCN_INTRUDE in the default option section as
		   it's now the default.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define action routine for VCPISWAT.
