Implement Return Address and Goto Return Address

A common address to jump to is the (near or far) return address of a
subroutine.  This is made easier by using shortened forms of the
commands one might use to extract these addresses.  The various
flavors of return addresses are (where LaSTK is the address of the
current stack pointer -- SS:SP if VM, SS|SP if PM and the B-bit in SS
is clear, and SS|ESP if PM and the B-bit in SS is set):

Keyword 	 Grammar Equivalent	Meaning
---------------------------------------------------------------------
.RETND		 {LaSTK 		Near dword
.RETNS		 [LaSTK 		Near word
.RETFD		 :{LaSTK or |{LaSTK	Far word:dword or word|dword
					(depending upon the VM bit in
					the current EFL)
.RETFS		 :[LaSTK or |[LaSTK	Far word:word or word|word
					(depending upon the VM bit in
					the current EFL)
.RETN		 .RETND or .RETNS	Depending upon the D-bit in CS
.RETF		 .RETFD or .RETFS	...
.IRET		 .RETF in VM		Also allows mode switch from
		 .RETFD in PM		PM to VM by checking VM bit
					in EFL above return address

As a common shortcut, .RETN and .RETF refer to one of the above forms
depending upon the setting of the D-bit in the current CS (that is,
whether we're running in a USE16 or USE32 segment).  Moreover, .IRET
can be used as a shorthand for .RETF with the added check on the VM
bit in the EFL above the return address.  If this bit is set, the
return address is interpreted as a VM address even though the current
mode is PM.

No magic is invoked to extract the return address if data has been
pushed onto the stack below the return address, so be sure that LaSTK
points to the actual return address.

Finally, the keystrokes A-F and A-N are defined as shortcuts for the
commands G .RETF and G .RETN, respectively.

Also, several commands/keywords which were omitted from previous TWTs
are now documented in the appropriate places.

386SWAT.DOC	 Note that NORMLIDT is the default.
		 Document RMLIDT command.
		 Document A-F and A-N keystrokes.
		 Document MACBASE command.
		 Document common memory reference keywords.

SWAT.ASM	 Define parse entries for A-F and A-N.
		 Define actions for A-F and A-N.

386SWAT.GRM	 Document EXIT command.
		 Document new dot commands.

SWAT_COM.INC	 Define IRETD_STR in a common place.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	 Include new keywords in parse table.
		 Define actions for new keywords.
		 Define subroutines for .RETF and .RETN so they can be
		   called via A-F and A-N.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	 Document new keystrokes.
		 Document new keywords.
		 Change documentation for MACBASE to match
		   386SWAT.DOC.

SWAT_KEY.ASM	 Move IRETD_STR to SWAT_COM.INC

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 Move IRETD_STR to SWAT_COM.INC
