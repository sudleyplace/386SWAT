Fix Bug In Implicit Stack References

When displaying the data (if any) pointed to by the current
instruction, if the instruction used an implicit stack reference (such
as the PUSH instruction) we sometimes would use the wrong base
register (ESP vs. SP).	This TWT fixes that bug.

SWAT_OPR.ASM	Switch the order of tests for ESP vs. SP as the base
		  register to use for implicit stack references.
