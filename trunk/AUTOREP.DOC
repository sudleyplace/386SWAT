Allow SWAT to Auto-Repeat On Certain Machines

Previously, we would re-enable the keyboard when we come up in case
something had disabled it beforehand (there's nothing more frustrating
than not to be able to type).  Unfortunately, re-enabling the keyboard
has an unpleasant side effect on some machines:  it causes them to
stop auto-repeating.

With this change, if we come up without displaying a message
(typically on a single-step or single-skip), we don't enable the
keyboard as it should already be enabled.

Note that messages such as "DRn trap" will cause us to continue to
give the keyboard a kick in the pants and consequently we might stop
autorepeating.

Also, we don't re-enable the keyboard if we're on an XT.  Previously,
we wouldn't re-enable if we were on an XT or MC system.  I can see no
reason to favor MC systems anymore.

This change affects SWAT.ASM only.
