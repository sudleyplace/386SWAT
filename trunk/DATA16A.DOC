Split Data Segment Into 16-bit and 32-bit

Now that SWAT has USE32 data, some of it needs to be addressible from
16-bit code segments, i.e.  real mode.	To avoid problems with
addressibility, I've split the data segment into DATA and DATA16 where
the latter segment should contain the data items which must be
addressible from real mode.

To test these changes, I put a big DB at the start of the 32-bit data
such that all of the 32-bit data was above 64KB.  This entailed a
slight delay as I had to write a new linker to handle this, but I'm
back now.

Most if not all of the changes involve moving data declarations and
EXTRNs to the DATA16 segment.

One bug is fixed in which a call to LIN2PPTE can signal a Page Fault
because we save two PDEs (on spec in case it crosses a 4MB boundary).
This can occur inside LIN2LIN where we need to get only one PDE.

DOSCALL.INC	 Make the DOSCALL macro sensitive to the value of
		   @WordSize so that it LEAs into a 16- or 32-bit
		   register as appropriate.

DPMI.INC	 Define record values for the Get/Set Page Attributes
		   function (needed for QLINK).

DTE.INC 	 Define DPLn and RPLn equates.

MASM5.MAC	 Change FICALLD macro to use DD on the label so it can
		   be used in a USE32 segment with a 32-bit offset.

PTR.INC 	 Define DQ_STR structure.

XMS.INC 	 Define @XMS_PRES and @XMS_ADDR equates and use them
		   in the macros.

MAKEFILE	 Define and use P1 as the path to search for INT1
		   source files.  This way, you need MD INT1 locally
		   and then copy only the changed files to this
		   subdirectory.  Previously, if a local mod involved
		   changes to INT1 code, you had to copy all the INT1
		   source files to the local directory.
		 Note dependency of SWAT_FCN.ASM on SWAT_SEG.INC.
		 Delete call to EXE2BIN and use /TINY switch on the
		   linker to create a .COM file for SWAT_HTX.

SWAT_SEG.INC	 Define new DATA16 segment and place at the start of
		   DGROUP.

POP87.ASM	 Move data declarations and/or EXTRNs to DATA16.

		   longer need to overcome that linker bug.

		 Use LOG2 macro even though it's zero.

SWAT_KTB.ASM	 Use type instead of constant.

SWAT_MEM.ASM	 Move data declarations and/or EXTRNs to DATA16.

SWAT_MSC.ASM	 Move data declarations and/or EXTRNs to DATA16.
