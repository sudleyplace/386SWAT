Fix Bug In LDT Display If Small Limit

When intruding into other memory manager's (and they're a strange
world), I found that one of them (NETROOM, I think) uses an LDT limit
of one (which means there's really no LDT).  However, our LDT display
code checks for a limit of zero to detect no LDT.  This change now
check for a limit less than the size of one DTE.  At the same time, I
rounded down the length for both GDT and LDT display to a DTE boundary
as I'm getting gun shy.

SWAT_DTE.ASM	 Round down GDT length to DTE boundary.
		 Check for at least one DTE before displaying LDT.
		 Round down LDT length to DTE boundary.
