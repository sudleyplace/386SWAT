Extend PTE Command to Alternate CR3s

With this change, the PTE command can take an optional physical
translation parameter so as to translate PTEs w.r.t. other memory
manager's page tables.  The new syntax is

PTE addr P exp
PTE exp  P exp

where the value to the right of the 'P' is the alternate CR3 to use in
translation.

386SWAT.GRM	 Document PTE command extensions.

SWAT_PTE.ASM	 Define additional variables to hold offset and CR3.
		 Define additional command line text to display.
		 Check for optional physical translation marker and
		   value.
		 If we're using optional physical translation, don't
		   worry if paging isn't enabled as yet.
		 Use LIN2PPDIR to address the first level PDIR
		   corresponding to the linear address to translate.
		 Display trailing text if using optional physical
		   translation.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 In LIN2PPTE, use XCHG instead of read/write.
		 Use 32-bit register when setting @PTE_URP (we're
		   USE32 now).
		 Define new routine LIN2PPDIR to address a first level
		   PDIR.
