Fix Disappearing Cursor Bug

For years we've put up with this bug.  Now it's fixed.

The problem occurs in any of three contexts:

* when reviewing last screens (Alt-F10),
* when switching between color and mono adapters (Alt-F7), or
* when swapping screens (say, when exiting SWAT).

The problem occurs because not all programs maintain a consistent set
of data values in the BIOS data area on which we rely (e.g., the
dependence between the cursor type and the cursor emulation bit).

The fix is to read the cursor start and end line values upon entry and
restore those values in the above circumstances.  A new routine,
GET6845 is defined for the read starting value part.  I seem to recall
that the original definition of the 6845 registers was that they were
write-only, but apparently they are now readable as well.

At the same time, while testing the different contexts in which SWAT
changes the cursor type, I noticed that the Enter command handles the
INS key, but not the XINS key, so I changed it.

SWAT_ENT.ASM	 Make XINS work the same as INS.

SWAT_VID.ASM	 Replace code which restores the old cursor type when
		   restoring screens with call to SET6845.
		 Replace code which gets old cursor type from the BIOS
		   data area with code which reads that value from the
		   6845.
		 Define routine GET6845 which reads 6845 register
		   values.
