Fix Bug in SWAT Not Restoring INT 24h Handler

When SWAT is processing the profile, it fails to restore the original
INT 24h handler because it doesn't handle reentrancy.  In particular,
when the profile is read in, the code save the address of the old INT
24h vector into OLDINT24_VEC, and then installs its own handler.  When
LOADSYM=, or VIDEO= is specified, the function to handle it also saves
the address of the old INT 24h handler into OLDINT24_VEC (thus
clobbering the original address from DOS) and installs its own
handler.  When FCN_PRO terminates it restores the INT 24h handler from
OLDINT24_VEC which has been clobbered.

This change pushes OLDINT24_VEC before calling INT24 and pops it after
calling REST24.  Also, some paths through LOADSYM, don't call INST24
but do call REST24; that's changed to always call them in pairs.

This change affects SWAT_FCN.ASM only.
