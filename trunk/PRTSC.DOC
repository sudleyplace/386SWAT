Use Ctrl-Shift-PrtSc To Print Instruction Window Only

When printing multiple instruction screens, repeating the register
display and other information on the second and subsequent screens is
unnecessary.  To this end, the key combination Ctrl-Shift-PrtSc prints
the instruction portion of the display only, assuming the instruction
window is displayed (if not, the entire screen is printed as usual).

Also, some A20 routines with code duplicated between two modules now
share a common source.	This means that some A20 routines are renamed
to begin with a special prefix such as U32_, U16_ and DEV_.

SWAT.ASM	Put code/data which must be first in a group into a
		  separate segment such as PROG0 and RCODE0.
		Rename A20 routines with special prefix.

SWAT_A20.ASM	Delete duplicated code, and use external routines from
		  SWAT_KEY.ASM.
		Rename A20 routines with special prefix.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	Put code/data which must be first in a group into a
		  separate segment such as PROG0 and RCODE0.
		Rename A20 variables with special prefix.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	Document new key combination.

SWAT_KEY.ASM	Use macros to define more A20 routines so that can be
		  defined in multiple groups.
		Rename A20 routines with special prefix.
		Detect and act upon C-S-PrtSc.
		In CMD_REBOOT, if we're running under Windows, ensure
		  that the low DOS memory is mapped in.
		Define needed A20 routines in RGROUP.

SWAT_KTB.ASM	Delete commented out code.

SWAT_SEG.INC	Define PROG0 and RCODE0 segments to hold code/data
		  which must be first in the group.

386SWAT.DOC	Document new key combination.
