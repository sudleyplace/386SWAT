Fix Bug in VCPI Debugging Support

VCPI debugging was broken in a previous TWT.  In particular, the
VCPICODE and VCPIDATA values were not setup at the proper time.  The
point at which they were being setup was prior to when another
variable (SWATDATA) had been initialized and so those values were not
correctly set.	Also, the VCPDTE_STR wasn't updated to reflect the DTE
for PGROUP2.

At the same time two other bugs were fixed:

* In SEL2GDT, if we passed in an LDT selector the TI bit was cleared
  just before it was tested (and cleared).

* In INIT_PROT, we must clear the value of PCUR_VM_HANDLE in case
  there's an old value lurking around.  If we don't, when Windows is
  brought up a second time, SWAT can get confused.

These changes affect SWAT_INI.ASM and SWAT_VCP.ASM.
