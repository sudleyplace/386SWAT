Implement AUTOFAULT Feature

After staring at a TSS fault for the longest time (and finally
figuring out that the NT bit was set incorrectly for an IRETD), I
decided to let the computer find this error for me.  With this
feature, when a TSS, Stack, GP, or Page Fault occurs, SWAT figures out
why and displays a message to that effect.

The previous AUTOFAULT message can be displayed by pressing Alt-F4.

For the moment, only TSS faults are handled, but the entire mechanism
is present.

In order to trap TSS faults, a new keyword (TRAPTSS) is defined along
with the machinery needed to put it into effect.  As this fault cannot
occur in RM/VM, there is no corresponding RMDEV0A handler, although
there is a @TRP_I0A entry so we can display the intercept state
correctly along with other intercepted interrupts.


386SWAT 	 Document new keyword.

MAKEFILE	 Define dependencies for new routine.
		 Respecify Set INCLUDE after call to MASM to make more
		   convenient grabbing lines from the screen
		   w/TALLSCREEN.

SWAT_AR2.INC	 Define static flag for TRAPTSS.

SWAT_DRV.INC	 Use record structure for TRP_FLAG.
		 Define @TRP_I0A flag.

SWAT_LC3.INC	 Define dynamic flag for TRAPTSS.

SWAT_LC4.INC	 Define flags for AUTOFAULT checking and message
		   display.

SWAT.ASM	 Define key Alt-F4 to display last AUTOFAULT message.
		 Set AFLCHK flag if no fault message.
		 If AUTOFAULT not already checked, check for it.
		 If AUTOFAULT message to be displayed, do so.

SWAT_AFL.ASM	 New routine to check for AUTOFAULTs.

SWAT_AGR.ASM	 Define routine SEL2TSS to convert a selector to a TSS
		   selector as appropriate.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Define parse entry for TRAPTSS.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	 Set TRP_FLAG is TRAPTSS is specified.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define action routine for TRAPTSS.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Initialize/uninitialize INT 0Ah handler if TRAPTSS is
		   specified.

SWAT_INT.ASM	 Fix bug in LCL_INT06 handler (use near jump instead
		   of far jump to avoid segment fixup).
		 Define INT 0Ah variables.
		 Define LCL_INT0A handler.

SWAT_OPR.ASM	 Define and set EA1TSEL as target selector of
		   effective address for use in TSS autofault
		   detection.

SWAT_SCR.ASM	 Define screen message to display if INT 0Ah
		   intercepted.

SWAT_TOG.ASM	 Define TOGINT0A entry.
