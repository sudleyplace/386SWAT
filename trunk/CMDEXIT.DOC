Implement Exit Command

A common command line sequence is to set AH to 4C, SIGINT 21, and G.
This is now done via a command called EXIT.

The following files are changed and why:

SWAT.ASM	 Move check for ESC to precede the one for SIGINT so
		   we can skip the breakpoint setting for EXIT.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	 Define entry for EXIT command.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	 Document EXIT command in help screen.

SWAT_SIG.ASM	 Define action for EXIT command.
