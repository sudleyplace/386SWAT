Make Device Driver SWAT Sensitive to Another Extended Memory Function

The recent change to 386MAX to support the 0E801h Extended Memory
function call needs to be copied to device SWAT not only so it can
detect how much extended memory is in the system, but also so it can
lie to any subsequent program requesting the extended memory size
through that interface.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	In RMDEV15, return DEVEXTSIZE from function 0E801h.
		In CHECK_EXT, see if the new Extended Memory Size
		  function is supported.
