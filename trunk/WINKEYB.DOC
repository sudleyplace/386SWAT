When Running Under Windows, Map In/Out VM's First Megabyte

Previously, when our local keyboard handler was active, we avoided
checking and setting the keyboard values in the BIOS data area if
Windows was active because we couldn't be sure that that memory region
was mapped in.	Now that I have discovered Win386 (INT 22h) services,
we can map in/out that region around references to it.

SWAT_INT.ASM	In LCL_INT09, if we're running under W and Win386
		  services are available, map in/out the VM's low
		  memory.

SWAT_KEY.ASM	In SAVE_IRQS/REST_IRQS, if we're running under W and
		  Win386 services are available, map in/out the VM's
		  low memory.
