Allow SWAT To Intrude Into 386MAX

Thanks to the extraordinary top of low DOS requirements of Win95, this
TWT is necessary -- it's the only way we can get SWAT to load with
386MAX.

The problem occurs because MAX uses a different first PDE when a VCPI
client is active than when it is inactive.  Among other things, this
means we need to put into place the outside VCPI PDE when we are
active as a VCPI client ourselves.

This involves

* detecting whether or not MAX is present,
* before entering PM via VCPI reading MAX's first PDE,
* after entering PM via VCPI swapping MAX's first PDE with the outside
  VCPI PDE, and restoring it upon exit.


At the same time (and somewhat related), this TWT includes the
following changes:

* Define a new DExx function to return various selectors for resident
  SWAT.  If these selectors (All Memory and CR3 linear) are present
  when intruding into a PL0 context, they are re-used instead of
  allocating new selectors.  Mostly this was of value for MMEXT, but
  it's not a bad idea when debugging SWAT so as to minimize the number
  of selectors SWAT needs.

* Take advantage of the above selectors (if present) and use them
  instead of allocating new ones.

* If we can find a selector in the MM's GDT which maps CR3 as a linear
  address, use it instead of allocating a new one.  This is done in
  the new routine FIND_MMCR3.

* Delete RUD_VCPI selector as we don't need or use it.

* Move the code which searches for available GDT entries to a
  subroutine (FIND_GDTE).

* Document this (as well as other changes which I forgot about) in
  386SWAT.DOC.


The following files are changed and why:

386SWAT.DOC	 Document changes.

VCPI.INC	 Define new function and subfunction to get SWAT
		   selectors.

MAKEFILE	 Define entry for and dependencies of new module.
		 Note dependency of SWAT_DR2.ASM on SWAT_VCP.INC.
		 Use $(MOPT) instead of $(AFLAGS) as we define the
		   former locally, not the latter.

SWAT_DR2.ASM	 Delete reference to RUD_VCPI as we don't need/use it.
		 If 386MAX present, restore the first PDE from the
		   VCPI inactive context.
		 If there's a previous CR3-linear selector (either
		   from a preceding SWAT or by finding it in the MM's
		   GDT), use it instead of allocating a new selector.
		 Move the code which searches for available GDT
		   entries to a subroutine.
		 If 386MAX present, restore the original first PDE.
		 Define routine to find CR3-linear in the MM's GDT.
		 In SET_RUDGDT, clear PL bits of incoming selector in
		   case set.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	 Define save area for preceding SWAT selectors.
		 Set flag for 386MAX if present.
		 If 386MAX present, call initialization routine.
		 Get preceding SWAT selectors if present.

SWAT_MAX.ASM	 Define new module for 386MAX-specific functions.
		 Define routine to read MAX's first PDE.
