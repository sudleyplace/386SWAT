ALTSCR.MDA						1-29-92

The altscr profile option sets the ARG_ALTSCR bit if the user wants
to use the alternate screen.  Previously, we checked the bit during
our initialization and during SWATTER.	If the main video is CO80,
this caused SWAT to start on the mono screen, and switch to the mono
screen upon each entry into SWATTER.
The new response to this falg is to have the initialization code
check this bit, but not check this bit upon each entry into SWATTER.
This allows the user to switch to the primary monitor, (via Alt-F7)
and not have SWAT automatically switch bacck to the mono monitor.
