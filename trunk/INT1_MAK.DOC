Reorganize INT1.EXE makefile

INT1.EXE is a standalone program for testing SWAT disassembly.	It
uses .OBJ files common to SWAT.

References to data and code within SWAT (but not in INT1.EXE) were
handled by placing them within IFNDEF INT1_DEF blocks, where it was
assumed that when INT1.EXE was compiled INT1_DEF would be defined.
This was an erroneous assumption, since the idea is to NOT recompile
the .OBJ files for INT1.EXE and SWAT.

Besides reorganizing the INT1.EXE makefile, this TWT also introduces
a new file to INT1.  INT1_STB.ASM contains stub code for 2 procedures
referenced in INT1_FNS.ASM, as well as needed data references.

Files affected:
INT1_STB.ASM	(new file) Contains data and procedural stubs to
		satisfy the linker for INT1.EXE.
MAKEFILE	Reorganized; new; improved.
