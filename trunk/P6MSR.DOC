Implement Support For P6 Features

Two P6 features are supported by this TWT.

* The Branch Trace Facility (BTF) can be turned on and off via the
  command line BTF ON/OFF.

* The Last Branch/Exeception From/To registers can be displayed
  at all times in the lower right corner of the screen.  This feature
  can be turned on and off via the command line LBR ON/OFF.


The following files are changed and why:

MAKEFILE	Define new module and its associated dependencies.
		Note dependency of SWAT.ASM on SWAT_LBR.INC.
		Note dependency of SWAT_INI.ASM on SWAT_LBR.INC.
		Note dependency of SWAT_SCR.ASM on SWAT_LBR.INC and
		  SWAT_LC4.INC.

386SWAT.DOC	Document new commands.

386SWAT.GRM	Document new grammar.

MSR.INC 	Split MSr definitions into P5 and P6 cases as they are
		  CPU-specific.  Note that @MSR_MCADDR is common to
		  all.

SWAT_LBR.INC	Define new module to hold the CLR_LBR macro.

SWAT_LC4.INC	Define new bits for BTF and LBR settings.
		Document bit definitions for all equates.

SWAT.ASM	Handle BTF and LBR (read/clear/set) upon entry to
		  SWATTER.
		When tracing over a PUSHFd, don't convert a trace into
		  a skip so we don't lose control.  This is a design
		  undersight in BTF.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	Define new error message.
		Include new commands in parse table.
		In GET_TOKNSUB, allow '.' as first character of token
		  so we can use dot commands.
		In PARSE_ATOM, parse the .LBRxx/.LEXxx tokens.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	Document new commands.

SWAT_INI.ASM	Define screen attribute for LBR/LEX window.
		Initialize LBR state in INIT_PROT.
		Save CPU family value in CPUFAM for later use.
		If P6, enable LBR and LBR window flags.

SWAT_INT.ASM	Clear the LBR register whenever we gain control so we
		  can reference the values before we change them
		  ourselves.
		Define the reset of the IZIT_IRQn routines and use
		  them.

SWAT_MSR.ASM	Define new module to handle Model-Specific Register
		  stuff.

SWAT_SCR.ASM	Display BTF=ON/OFF state on screen.
		Display LBR window as appropriate.
