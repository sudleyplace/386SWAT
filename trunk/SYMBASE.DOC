Allow Optional Physical Base Address for LOADSYM Symbols

For the case where 386MAX uses the physical memory at the default base
address of 00110000h, an optional switch is provided to the LOADSYM=
keyword to load and restore the symbol file to and from another
physical base address.

At the same time the routine FCN_SYMLOAD is renamed to FCN_LOADSYM to
match the documented keyword rather than the undocumented alias.

The following modules are changed and why:

386SWAT 	 Note optional switch on LOADSYM= keyword.

SWAT_ARG.ASM	 Rename FCN_SYMLOAD to FCN_LOADSYM.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Define error message in case the switch is not
		   recognized.
		 Rename FCN_SYMLOAD to FCN_LOADSYM.
		 Check for optional switch characters.
