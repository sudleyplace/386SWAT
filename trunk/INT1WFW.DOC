FIX file entry:

* Add new Windows for Workgroups VxDs to 386SWAT's disassembly comments

  Description:	Windows for Workgroups is implemented mostly by six new VxDs.
		INT 20h dynalinks to their services show up as 'Unknown'.
		This TWT add the new VxDs to the comment tables in SWAT.
		These new VxDs also provide services.  These are all
		undocumented at this time.  I have figured out several critical
		ones, and added names for them to the tables.
		More of the standard Windows 3.1 VxDs and their services have
		been added as well.
		The code that displays the device and service names has been
		changed to display the name of a device even when we don't
		understand the service.  Previously the entire thing was listed
		as 'Unknown'.
  When: 30 SEP 92.
  Who:	WRL
  SW/HW Environment:  Debugging inside Windows for Workgroups.
  Symptom:  INT 20h instructions display as unknown xxxx, xxxx.
  Temporary Workaround:  Simply remember even more hex constants.
  Test Procedure:  Disassemble some VXDCALLs refering to the new VxDs
  Version:  2.00.006

INT1_FNS.ASM	Display the device name even if its service is unknown.
