Compatibility With PMODE

There is a popular shareware DOS extender available on the Internet
called PMODE which is used to create PM programs.  When it is run as a
VCPI client, it allocates selectors from the top down in the GDT --
the same as SWAT does.	PMODE uses the AVL bit in the DTE to mark a
selector as in use, so this change has us set that bit as well so
PMODE doesn't write on top of our selectors.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 Set $DTE_AVL in selectors allocated when intruding
		   into a VCPI client.
