Allow BC Values To Be Set Over Single Step

Previously, if we had a BC set in (say) an interrupt handler and we
signle-step, we didn't enable the BC settings.  Only if we ESCaped did
we put the BC settings into effect.  As a result, we might not catch
some BC settings.  This TWT fixes that; however, we are still subject
to the limitation that if the current instruction has a BC setting in
effect for it, we do not put the current BC settings into effect.
This needs to be fixed, but not in this TWT.

This change affects SWAT.ASM only.

Also, I changed the directory to which the SWAT.MAP file is copied
from PSSDIR to SYSDIR (the same as to where the executable is copied).

This change affects MAKEFILE only.
