Implement Line # Disable Switch to LOADSYM

Because I don't use line numbers very often, I've implemented a new
switch (/LI-) to the LOADSYM keyword which initially disables line
numbers.  To re-enable them, use LI+ from the SWAT command line.

At the same time, I fixed a bug in the processing of LOADSYM switches
where we would increment the text pointer one too many times.  The
effect would be to generate an error if the switches weren't separated
by (say) a blank.

386SWAT 		Document new switches to LOADSYM.

SWAT_FCN.ASM		Delete extra increments to text pointer.
			Parse /LI- to disable line numbers.
