Fix Bug When Intruding

If we intrude into another memory manager's PL0 context, and the first
entry into SWAT after that is into a VCPI client's context, then some
of SWAT's local variables are mis-set.  To avoid this, we need to call
SETUP one more time.  The simplest way is to clear the
setup-has-been-done bit after intruding because some of the variables
have been changed at that point.

MAKEFILE	 Note dependency of SWAT_DR2.ASM on SWAT_LC4.INC.

SWAT_DR2.ASM	 Clear LC4_SETUP after INIT_PROT (which sets that
		   bit).  The subsequent selector changes require
		   another call to SETUP.
