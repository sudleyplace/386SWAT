Display MAC Entries

After many years of wading through MAC entries, I decided to implement
a separate display screen for them (actually, Win95 pushed me over the
edge -- this is a variant of "The devil made me do it").

The keyboard combination of Ctl-M brings up this screen.

There's also a separate command MACBASE which allows you to set the
base address of the MAC chain in case it's different from .DMAC.  This
is handy when displaying the DOS subsegment chain.

At the same time, I collapsed the multiple screen scrolling entries in
SWAT.ASM into a single macro.

386SWAT.GRM	 Document new command line syntax.

MAKEFILE	 Introduce a new module and its dependencies.

SWAT_COM.INC	 Define a new screen display type.

SWAT.ASM	 Define MAC index.
		 Collapse multiple screen scrolling entries into a
		   single macro.
		 Change @DSP_INSTR to @DSP_IREGS for consistency.

SWAT_BLK.ASM	 Change @DSP_INSTR to @DSP_IREGS for consistency.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	 Include new command in parse table.

SWAT_FBR.ASM	 Change @DSP_INSTR to @DSP_IREGS for consistency.

SWAT_HTX.ASM	 Document new command line and keyboard commands.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 In INIT_REAL, save initial MACBASE (i.e., the
		   equivalent of an initial MACBASE .DMAC).

SWAT_MAC.ASM	 Define new module containing MAC display code.

SWAT_REG.ASM	 Change @DSP_INSTR to @DSP_IREGS for consistency.

SWAT_SIG.ASM	 Change @DSP_INSTR to @DSP_IREGS for consistency.

SWAT_UNA.ASM	 Change @DSP_INSTR to @DSP_IREGS for consistency.
