Handle Page Up With Symbols Active

When PgUp on the instruction screen is encountered, we didn't use to
calculate the size of the previous page correctly if it included one
or more symbols.  In particular, we would page back more lines than
necessary; the amount was off by the same number of lines as there
were symbols.

This TWT takes into account the presence of symbols in the previous
page and pages back only as far as necessary.  In particular (with two
exceptions), PgUp and PgDn are inverses of each other.	The first
exception is when we page back beyond offset 0 (we don't wrap).  The
second exception is when the previous page would start with an
instruction for which there is a label.  Because we don't display the
instruction without the label, we page back an extra line to include
the label display.

This change affects SWAT.ASM only.

At the same time, I corrected a bug in DISPINSTR where we calculated
the value of INSTRCNT (the number of instructions disassembled)
incorrectly if the last line was labeled.  Moreover, this variable is
misnamed as it is actually the number of lines in the disassembly
window and has been renamed to reflect that meaning.

This change affects SWAT_BLK.ASM only.
