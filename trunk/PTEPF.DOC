Avoid Page Fault on LIN2PPTE Accesses

The LIN2PPTE subroutine translates a linear address to a pointer to
the corresponding PTE according to a specific CR3.  Sometimes we need
to read more than one PTE from the Page Directory which doesn't always
work (because the subroutine doesn't know how many PTEs to map in the
case we're not mapping relative to the current CR3).  A solution to
this is to tell the subroutine how many PTEs are to be mapped in.

This change also applies to LIN2PPDIR and the cleanup routine
LIN2PPTEZ.

SWAT_AFL.ASM	 Use new interface.

SWAT_FVM.ASM	 Use new interface.

SWAT_PTE.ASM	 Use new interface.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	 Use new interface.
		 Redefine LIN2PPTE, LIN2PPDIR, and LIN2PPTEZ to
		   implement new interface.
