Allow LOADSYM With Small HPDA

Previously, when LOADSYM was used, it told MAX to provide a full HPDA
(6800 bytes or so) although it wasn't needed under all circumstances.
In particular, the full HPDA is needed only if file browser or other
DPMI translation services are used in SWAT.  This change flips the
default behavior to use a small HPDA and implements a switch on the
LOADSYM command (/H) to tell MAX to provide the full HPDA.

The following modules are changed and why:

386SWAT 	 Document new flag for LOADSYM.

SWAT_AR2.INC	 Define new flag bit.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Document and parse new syntax.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Test new flag bit.
