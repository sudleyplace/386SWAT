Enable Debugging Extensions (If Supported) At Virtual Init Time

The Pentium CPU's debugging extensions are supported in SWAT via the
BD command on an I/O port at which time the $DE bit is set in CR4.
This change enables them at an earlier time so any other program (such
as 386MAX) can modify its behavior depending upon whether or not the
$DE bit is set.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	In LCL_INT67_HOST, enable debugging extensions if
		  supported.
