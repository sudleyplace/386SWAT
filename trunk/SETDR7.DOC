Allow DR7 to be Set in SWAT

Previously, the Register set command allowed DR7 to be set, but the
register value wasn't actually changed.  That's because we save DR7 at
the very beginning of 386SWAT and reset the register to zero so
accesses within SWAT don't generate breakpoints.  The value that the
Register command should change is SAVE_DR7 which is what this TWT
accomplishes.
