 
  Greetings, Tran (a.k.a. Thomas Pytel) here. This is version 3.07 of PMODE,
my protected mode DOS extender. It is publicly available and is not
confidential or proprietary. I, Thomas Pytel, reserve all rights to the source
code. However, feel free to use or distribute them in any manner you wish
(with the exception of selling PMODE itself (read the dox)). All I ask, if you
use this code in some production, commercial or non-commercial, is credits.

  This package is meant mainly as an update for coders already using PMODE,
But you can use it to start from scratch. The code and documentation may not
be thoroughly clear, in this case if you need more examples get some of the
other PMODE releases (like PMC or any demo source codes I have released) for
more practical examples.

  Today I am feeling as stupid as I am. My mind has pulled another one of
those little tricks it plays on me. But the bug I put in v3.06 has now been
dismembered. Oh yeah, to those of you who can't figure out why you can not get
even 4M of extended memory under a VCPI server if you got more in the system,
try increasing the _pm_pagetables variable.

  This file is dated as of Decamber 5, 1994. Enjoy protected mode. You can
send me mail, but I can not reply due to the fact that I do not have real
Inet access (tell me about all the nice bugs you find that I put in this
version). This account seems to lie around but can only recieve mail (not
send) - tran@phantom.com. Another place is mail on Data Connection BBS at
703-506-8598 or 703-847-0861 to 'Tran'.

        Heaven is really hell with more letters and spelled differently...
