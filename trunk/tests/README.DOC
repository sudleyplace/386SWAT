Hi,
	This directory contains TRAN's PMODE, version 3.07.  He said
	in his docs the sources are redistributable and I am doing just
	that.  Note that the only changes I have made to his sources
	are to rename his segment classes from 'CODE' to 'TRAN'
	to make them distinct from the rest of the system I am putting
	this into.

	Read tran's .DOC files for copyright information and general
	information on how to use his programs
