* Avoid Crash If Preceding INT 67h Vector Is Zero

When SWAT installs as a device driver and hooks INT 67h (to monitor
VCPI and local SWAT functions), it's possible that the preceding
interrupt vector is 0:0.  In that case, if an INT 67h call comes along
which is not one of ours, it can be fatal.  This happens with IBM's
PC-DOS 6.3 which notes that the INT 67h vector is non-zero (it points
to SWAT), but doesn't bother to look for the EMMXXXX0 device name.

This change tests for that condition and, if present, installs a local
INT 67h handler preceding SWAT's handler which returns an error code
to the INT 67h call.

Also included are some minor changes to MAKEFILE.

MAKEFILE	 Use $(1) instead of INT1\ to parallel later use.
		 Avoid problem with MASM where it fails to find
		   include files after invalid (to it) path in the
		   INCLUDE environment variable.  In particular, it
		   doesn't like "." as a path.
		 Use separate entry for $(I01DIR).ASM to .OBJ files
		   to allow more flexibility in processing separate
		   INT1\ sub-directory entries.
		 Fix bug in reference to INT1_xxx.INC include entries.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	 Define label for failing INT 67h calls.
		 At the end of SETINTS, check for preceding INT 67h
		   vector being 0:0.  If so, save address of a local
		   INT 67 handler as the preceding entry.
