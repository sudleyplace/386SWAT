Make Device Driver SWAT Sensitive to PCI Extended Memory Function

The recent change to 386MAX to support the PCI Extended Memory
function call needs to be copied to device SWAT not only so it can
detect how much extended memory is in the system, but also so it can
lie to any subsequent program requesting the extended memory size
through that interface.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	Widen DEVEXTSIZE from word to dword.
		In RMDEV15, return min(DEVEXTSIZE.ELO,0FFFFh) from
		  function 88h, and return DEVEXTSIZE from function
		  0DA88h.
		In CHECK_EXT, see if the PCI Extended Memory Size
		  function is supported.
