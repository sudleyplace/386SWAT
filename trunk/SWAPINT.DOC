Fix Bug When Swapping INTs

When we swap IDT entries (say when displaying the IDT via F4) so we
see or act upon the global IDT entries, we don't swap INTs 74h and
76h.  Now we do.

SWAT_DTE.ASM	 Save and restore INTs 74h and 76h in SWAP_OLDINTS
		   and REST_OLDINTS.

SWAT_KEY.ASM	 When checking on other references to these
		   interrupts, I made minor changes.
