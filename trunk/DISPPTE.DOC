Widen PTE Display

If we have more then 16MB of PTEs, we use to truncate the display
there and wrap to zero.  As systems have more memory, we need to
display more PTEs.  This change widens the displayed offset from a
word to a dword and at the same time (unless we're under Windows)
truncates the PTE display at the limit of the CR3 selector passed to
SWAT by 386MAX.  This has the effect of noting the effective end of
the PTE display by displaying blanks after the last valid PTE setup by
386MAX.

This change affects SWAT.ASM and SWAT_DTE.ASM.
