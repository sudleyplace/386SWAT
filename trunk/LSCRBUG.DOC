Fix Bug In Last Screen Number Display

When converting SWAT to USE32, I missed an instance where in DD2DEC,
we LEA an address from the stack (off of EBP) into a 16-bit register.
This has the effect of storing the decimal display into the address
modulo 64KB.  To fix this, I widened the incoming address from ES|DI
to ES|EDI.  This entailed other changes, and pretty soon you're
talking five modules.

P87_DISP.ASM	 In GET_SCR_OFF, widen the output from 16- to 32-bits,
		   and all associated changes.
		 In FMTSUB, widen input from 16- to 32-bits.
		 In FMTDIG, widen all inputs from 16- to 32-bits.
		 In DD2DEC, widen input from 16- to 32-bits.

SWAT.ASM	 Widen LSCR_CNT from word to dword and relocate for
		   better alignment.
		 Widen NLSTBUF from word to dword.
		 Widen PLSTBUF_IND from word to dword.
		 Widen input address to DD2DEC from 16- to 32-bits.

SWAT_FBR.ASM	 Delete unused extrn.

SWAT_FCN.ASM	 Widen NLSTBUF from word to dword.

SWAT_INI.ASM	 Widen PLSTBUF_IND from word to dword.
		 Widen NLSTBUF from word to dword.
