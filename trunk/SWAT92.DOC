Workaround A20 vs. I/O Port 92h Bugs

Alas, from the no-good-deed-goes-unpunished file, it turns out that on
some systems the very act of writing to I/O port 92h (the actual value
doesn't matter) gates A20 on, but then that's all she wrote.  No
further writes to 92h or to the 8042 for that matter have any effect.

As this causes us some problems, we need to recognize this situation
and avoid it.  On the system I encountered with this hardware bug, the
input value of I/O port 92h is 0C0h, so the test used checks for the
two high-order bits on.  If that's a valid I/O port (at least in MCA
parlance), that would mean that both Fixed Disk lights are on, which
is, I trust, an unlikely event.  This also catches the case where the
I/O port has no effect and a read returns 0FFh.

SWAT_A20.ASM	 Check for invalid value from I/O port 92h before
		   writing to it.
