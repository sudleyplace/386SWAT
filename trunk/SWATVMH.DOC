The implementation of the SuperVM feature of Cannonball involve much switching
between VMs via schedule events in WIN386.  The changes in this TWT are
intended to make SWAT more useful to debug these situations, by displaying
the current VM handle in the F9 register screen.

The display of certain VMM INT 20h services has been fixed.

The SWATINFO structure has been changes to support the third SWAT selector.


Shortly after INIT_PROT is called, SWATVXD issues two new INT 67h calls to
SWAT.LOD to pass the addresses of the Sys_VM_Handle and Cur_VM_Handle global
variables within WIN386.  When SWAT pops up under Windows, the register display
includes the current VM handle as an 8-digit hex value just above the stack
display.

What's changed...

VCPI.INC		Add equates for new @VCPI_DBGWINVARS services.

INT1\INT1_WIN.ASM	Correct VMM services that changed position during the
			  Windows 3.1 beta.

SWAT_INF.INC		Bump the SWATINFO structure version # to 5.
			Add the SWTINF_PG2BASE and SWTINF_PG2LEN fields to
			  hold the offset and size of PGROUP2 for the VxD.

SWAT.ASM		Remember Cur_VM_Handle for the next invocation of
			  SWATTER.

SWAT_BLK.ASM		Display Cur_VM_Handle on F9 screen.

SWAT_SCR.ASM		Define globals to hold Sys_VM_Handle and Cur_VM_Handle.
			Add DISPVMHANDLE procedure to display Cur_VM_Handle
			  just above the stack display.

SWAT_VCP.ASM		Add new @VCPI_DBGWINVARS service.  Initially this
			  supports @DBGWINVARS_CURVM and @DBGWINVARS_SYSVM.
