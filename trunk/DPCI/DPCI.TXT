Dual PCI VGA Adapter Routines

While adding support to 386SWAT for dual PCI VGA adapters, I learned a
bit about PCI programming which I thought I'd share with others.

The assembler code contains routines to detect dual PCI VGA adapters
and enable and disable them.  The case where there is an AGP
controller in the picture is covered as well.

There are two distinct cases covered by this code.

1.	A monochrome adapter is in the system, but isn't visible because
	it is hidden by an AGP controller.	Use DPCI MONO to test this
	case.

2.	Two (or more) PCI VGA adapters are in the system, one is the
	primary, one is the secondary.	Use DPCI DVGA to test this case.

Note that we support access mechanism #1 only.

Thanks go to Dominik Behr, Federico Bianchi, Ralf Brown, and others 
for their helpful suggestions and/or source code.
