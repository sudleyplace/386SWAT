Skip Over Additional Debug Faults With DR7.GD=1

If we're trying to keep the debug registers to ourselves by setting
DR7.GD=1, there are some additional cases where SWAT references the
debug registers which we should allow to work.	These cases occur when
a program uses the VCPI debug interface to request certain functions
and we call the READ_CR3 subroutine in the process of flushing the
TLB.

At the same time, a NEWDIR bug in MAKEFILE is fixed where we reference
an incorrect directory for 386MAX .OBJ files.

MAKEFILE	 Use OEM directory under $(SWTDIR) to get 386MAX .OBJ
		   files.

SWAT.ASM	 Skip over debug fault if it's in READ_CR3.

SWAT_MSC.ASM	 Make public the ending address of READ_CR3.
