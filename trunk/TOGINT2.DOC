Fix Bug In TOGINT

The change which put in the TOGINT feature contained a bug where the
stack would get out of synch under device SWAT.  Also, I found yet
another LINKer bug.  With this one, in a group bigger than 64KB (in
this case PGROUP), any segment fixup beyond 64KB is applied to the
address modulo 64K.  There was one such fixup in TOGGLE_TRP.

SWAT_TOG.ASM	 Define data item to hold seg PGROUP as the fixup in
		   TOGGLE_TRP is beyond 64KB.
		 Include additional ASSUMEs for TOGGLE_TRP.
		 Fix bug where the call to TOGGLE_TRP and the
		   definition of the stack is mismatched.
