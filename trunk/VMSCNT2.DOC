Fix bug introduced with VMSCOUNT

When VMSCOUNT was introduced to enable VMSINT debugging of
background VCPI programs (like PIPES), the whole VMSINT
mechanism was broken.

Other minor enhancements:
* Symbol names longer than 80 characters (as may be introduced
  by a bug in symbol loader code) no longer trash SWAT
* Ctrl-Bksp deletes the entire command line and homes the cursor
* Symbol proximity offsets are now displayed in hex

Files affected:

INT1_FNS.ASM	Display symbol proximity offsets in hex.  The
		maximum possible proximity value is FF.

SWAT_CMD.ASM	Implement Ctrl-Bksp (clear command line and reset
		cursor to home position).

SWAT_SYM.ASM	Accommodate symbol names up to 255 characters in length.
		Incidentally, don't let garbage symbol records break
		SWAT.

		When replacing a symbol with a duplicate name, also
		change the group ID number.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	Add missing jump target in VMSINT code.
