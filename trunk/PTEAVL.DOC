Workaround Feature In Win95

Because of a quirk in Win95 (what only one!), when we blast in the
PTEs for SWAT to address the monochrome and color video buffers from
local addresses, we need to preserve the AVL bits and set the accessed
bit so this PTE won't be thought of as one available for allocation.

SWAT_FVM.ASM	In SET_VIDPTE, preserve the PTE_AVL bits when setting
		  our video PTEs.
