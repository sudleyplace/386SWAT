Fix Bug When Testing For Extended Memory

Due to an oversight, when I put in the code to determine the amount of
extended memory using the INT 15h/0E801h call, I put it in after the
INT 15h/0DA88h, instead of before.  Because of a bug in Phoenix 4.04
BIOSes, which crash on the 0DA88h call, the order is important.

Also, when setting up the IDT entry for VCPI debugging using TSSes, we
used to set the offset to -1 (because the IDT selector is a TSS and
the offset isn't used).  For convenience, I'm now setting the
low-order byte of the offset to the interrupt #.  That way, when
looking at the IDT in memory (not via F4) it's easy to tell which
interrupt it covers.

SWAT_DRV.ASM	Reverse the order of INT 15h calls which request the
		  amount of extended memory.

SWAT_VCP.ASM	In SETTSS, set the low-order byte of the IDT entry
		  offset to the interrupt #.
