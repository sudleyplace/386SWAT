		    Avance Logic driver notes


Notes:

    This is based upon the stub driver implementation, with 
    ALG-specific code added bit by bit.

    Information on the Avance Logic range of cards is taken 
    from the VGADOC package.

    As far as I know, this driver should support the following 
    cards:

	ALG-2101, ALG-2201, ALG-2228, ALG-2301, ALG-2302

    Some of these cards can provide hardware acceleration on
    blits and lines, and a hardware cursor.  Support for these
    features is not yet implemented into this driver.


Special note for ALG-2101 and ALG-2302 users:

    I'm not quite sure how to tell the difference between
    ALG-2101 and ALG-2302; I have the latter but have found
    no specific documentation about it.  The documented
    detection routines return ALG-2101.  I have used an 
    underdocumented register to try to tell the difference,
    but this might not work.  If you have either of these
    and the driver detects the wrong one, please let me know.
    It won't affect the operation of the driver; it's just
    nice when a program detects your hardware correctly.


History:
    13/04/98 -- first version; just a copy of the stub driver.

    15/04/98 -- removed VESA code, replaced with hardware-
		level code.

    20/04/98 -- finished implementing DrawScan, started lying
		about supporting hardware acceleration, tested with 
		Allegro, corrected big bug in DrawScan.

    01/11/98 -- Shawn Hargreaves removed hardware acceleration bodge: it 
		now admits that it is a dumb framebuffer driver :-)
