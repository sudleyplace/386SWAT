Introduction

   VBE/AF is a low level driver interface for accessing graphics hardware. 
   It provides all the same features as VESA 3.0 (access to linear 
   framebuffer video memory, high speed protected mode bank switching, page 
   flipping, hardware scrolling, etc), and adds the ability to use 2D 
   hardware acceleration in an efficient and portable manner. An /AF driver 
   is provided as a disk file (vbeaf.drv), and contains clean 32 bit machine 
   code which can be called directly by a C program. If implemented 
   correctly, these drivers have the potential to be binary portable across 
   multiple operating systems, so the same driver file can be used from DOS, 
   Windows, Linux, etc.

   FreeBE/AF is an attempt to implement free VBE/AF drivers on as many cards 
   as possible. This idea came about on the Allegro mailing list, due to the 
   need for a dynamically loadable driver structure that could support 
   hardware acceleration. VBE/AF seemed to fit the bill, and Allegro already 
   had support for the SciTech drivers, so it seemed like a good idea to 
   adopt this format for ourselves. The primary goal is to make these 
   drivers work with Allegro, so the emphasis will be on implementing the 
   functions that Allegro actually uses, but we encourage other developers 
   to join us in taking advantage of this excellent driver architecture.

   This project currently provides fully accelerated drivers for a handful 
   of chipsets, plus a number of dumb framebuffer implementations based on 
   the video drivers from older versions of the Allegro library. It has also 
   defined a few extensions to the stock VBE/AF API, which allow Allegro 
   programs to use these drivers in a true protected mode environment 
   without having to resort to the nearptr hack, and provide a number of 
   hook functions that will be needed to remain compatible with future 
   generations of the SciTech drivers.

   The current status of the VBE/AF standard is somewhat confused. It was 
   designed by SciTech Software (<a href="http://www.scitechsoft.com/">http://www.scitechsoft.com/</a>), who provide 
   commercial VBE/AF drivers for a wide range of cards as part of their 
   Display Doctor package. It was originally going to be released as a VESA 
   standard, but the VESA people seriously messed this up by charging 
   exorbitant sums of $$$ for copies of the spec. As a result, very few 
   people bothered to support these drivers, and the FreeBE/AF project was 
   only made possible by the information available in the SciTech MGL 
   library source code, and the helpfulness of Kendall Bennett (the designer 
   of the spec) himself. Unfortunately SciTech have now abandoned VBE/AF 
   themselves, replacing it with an equivalent but non-public API called 
   Nucleus, which is only available under NDA. SciTech will continue to 
   provide VBE/AF drivers for the cards which they already support, but 
   will not adding any new ones in the future, so this project is now the 
   only active source of VBE/AF driver implementations.

   At present, the Allegro (<a href="http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/">http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/</a>) and MGL 
   (<a href="http://www.scitechsoft.com">http://www.scitechsoft.com</a>) libraries are the only major packages which 
   can take advantage of accelerated VBE/AF drivers. As such, this project 
   is starting to look more like a implementation of video drivers 
   specifically for the Allegro library, rather than a potential 
   industry-wide standard :-) But it doesn't have to be this way! VBE/AF is 
   technically an excellent design: efficient, easy to write and use, and 
   highly portable. If you are writing graphics code, and getting frustrated 
   by the many limitiations imposed by VESA, why not think about using 
   VBE/AF instead? Even better, if you have a card that our project doesn't 
   yet support, why not add a new driver for it? This can be a lot of fun, 
   and we would be delighted to offer any help or advice that you might need.

Usage

   Each driver is located in a different subdirectory. Run "make" to compile 
   them, choose the one you want, copy the vbeaf.drv file from this 
   directory to c:\, and you are ready to go!

   The stub directory contains a generic non-accelerated VBE/AF driver. This 
   is not useful in any way, because it simply sits on top of your existing 
   VESA driver and emulates a few "hardware" drawing operations with very 
   slow software implementations. The stub is intended as a starting point 
   for people who want to make drivers for a specific card, and should not 
   be used directly.

   To recompile FreeBE/AF, you need a working copy of djgpp. Run "make" to 
   build all the available drivers, or "make dir/vbeaf.drv" to compile a 
   specific driver (replacing {dir} with the directory name, eg. "make 
   stub/vbeaf.drv"). To build the install.exe program for a binary 
   distribution, run "make all" (this requires you to have the Allegro 
   library installed, and the allegro/tools/ directory in your path). This 
   documentation is converted from the custom ._tx format into ASCII and 
   HTML by the Allegro makedoc program: run "make docs" to do this, after 
   putting the makedoc utility somewhere in your path.

   FreeBE/AF only supports the VBE/AF 2.0 API. It is not backward compatible 
   with the assembler VBE/AF 1.0 interface, and programs that try to use 
   those obsolete functions will not work correctly.

Supported Hardware

   Not all VBE/AF drivers provide the complete set of possible features. 
   Some may be written in a 100% clean and portable manner, allowing them to 
   be used on any platform, but others make use of the video BIOS in order 
   to set the initial video mode: this makes them a lot easier to write, but 
   means that it can only be used under DOS. Some of the drivers, in 
   particular the ones based on the old Allegro library chipset support, 
   don't support any hardware accelerated drawing at all: these are still 
   usefull because they provide high speed protected mode bank switching and 
   can work around the bugs in some manufacturer's VESA implementations, but 
   are obviously not nearly as cool as a fully accelerated driver.

Contributing

   If you want to add a new driver, follow these steps:
<pre>
      md cardname
      copy stub\*.* cardname
      edit makefile
      { add a new entry to the DRIVERS variable at the top of the file }
      cd cardname
      edit drvhdr.c
      { replace "stub driver implementation" with your driver name }
      edit driver.c
      { fill in the blanks, replacing the VESA calls with chipset-specific }
      { code, and fleshing out the accelerated drawing functions }
      edit notes.txt
      { describe anything interesting about your driver, most importantly }
      { listing what drawing functions it supports in hardware }
      cd..
      done!
</pre>
   The makefile requires each driver to provide a drvhdr.c file, which will 
   be linked into the drvgen.exe utility and used to generate the VBE/AF 
   header. You must also provide a notes.txt, which will be displayed by the 
   installation program, but everything else is entirely up to you. Any C 
   source files placed into your driver directory will automatically be 
   compiled and linked into the driver binary, so you can organise your code 
   in whatever style you prefer.

   Because the VBE/AF drivers are output as relocatable binary modules, they 
   cannot use any C library functions. There are a few utility functions in 
   helper.c, but these will not work on any platforms other than DOS+DPMI, 
   so it would be better to avoid using them if you can manage without.

   A great deal of hardware information can be found in the VGADOC package 
   (<a href="ftp://x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/msdos/programming/docs/vgadoc4b.zip">ftp://x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/msdos/programming/docs/vgadoc4b.zip</a>) and the 
   XFree86 sources (<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">http://www.xfree86.org/</a>). If this isn't enough, try 
   asking the manufacturer for more details.

   The Video Electronics Standards Association does _not_ deserve any

History

   30 March, 1998 - v0.1.
      First public release, containing an example driver implementation that 
      runs on top of VESA.

   31 March, 1998 - v0.11.
      Added support for multi-buffered modes.

   5 April, 1998 - v0.2.
      Added an accelerated Matrox driver.

   8 April, 1998 - v0.3.
      Added accelerated drivers for ATI mach64 and Cirrus 54x cards, plus 
      minor updates to the Matrox driver.

   12 April, 1998 - v0.4.
      Proper installation program, more drawing functions implemented by the 
      stub and Matrox drivers, improved ATI driver, compiled with PGCC for a 
      5% speed boost.

   26 April, 1998 - v0.5.
      More accelerated features in the Cirrus and ATI drivers. Fixed bugs in 
      the Matrox driver. Added an option to disable hardware emulation in 
      the stub driver, which produces a non-accelerated, dumb framebuffer 
      implementation. The init code will now politely fail any programs that 
      try to use VBE/AF 1.0 functions, rather than just crashing.

   10 June, 1998 - v0.6.
      Fixed scrolling problem on Millenium cards.

   1 November, 1998 - v0.7.
      Added drivers for Trident TGUI 9440 and Avance Logic cards, and 
      improved the build process.

   14 December, 1998 - v0.8.
      Bugfixes to the Matrox Millenium II and Cirrus drivers. Converted all 
      the old Allegro library chipset drivers into non-accelerated VBE/AF 
      format, adding support for ATI 18800/28800, Paradise, S3, Trident, 
      Tseng ET3000/ET4000/ET6000, and Video-7 boards. Designed and 
      implemented an API extension mechanism, providing the ability to use 
      these drivers in a true protected mode environment, a more rational 
      relocation scheme, and various hooks that will later be needed for 
      supporting the SciTech Nucleus drivers.

   20 December, 1998 - v0.9.
      Bugfixes. Added a config mechanism, allowing the install program to 
      optionally disable some features of a driver.

   3 January, 1999 - v1.0
      Bugfixes.

   27 March, 1999 - v1.1
      Added acceleration support to the S3 driver, plus some bugfixes.
