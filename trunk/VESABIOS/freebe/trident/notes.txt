		    Trident driver implementation notes.



   This is a software-only driver for Trident chipsets, based on the native 
   Trident driver from old versions of the Allegro library. It only supports 
   256 color modes, and has no support for linear framebuffers or 
   accelerated drawing. This code has been made obsolete by the accelerated 
   TGUI driver recently written by SET, and is included only because it may 
   support a slightly wider range of chipset variants. Any future 
   development effort should be spent on improving the TGUI driver instead 
   of this one.

   This code is not portable to any platforms other than DOS+DPMI, because 
   it uses BIOS calls to set the initial video mode.
