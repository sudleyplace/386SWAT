		  Video-7 driver implementation notes.



   This is a software-only driver for Video-7 chipsets, based on the native 
   Video-7 driver from old versions of the Allegro library. It only supports 
   256 color modes, and has no support for linear framebuffers or 
   accelerated drawing. As such it is useful primarily because it is faster 
   than the VESA 1.x bank switching mechanism, and as a workaround for the 
   many bugs in common VESA driver implementations.

   This code is not portable to any platforms other than DOS+DPMI, because 
   it uses BIOS calls to set the initial video mode.

   Any volunteers to add hardware accelerator support? That would be very 
   welcome if you want to do it :-)
