Fix Rounding Bug In Initialization

When we allocate the local stack, we round up its size without
including the rounded portion in the uninitialized data.  This can
cause us to fail much later (when we take our first interrupt) because
the stack offset of our local stack is out of bounds for the stack
selector.

This is a problem only when loading SWAT directly (such as in QMT from
RM) where we happen not to round up the data portion of SWAT to a
paragraph boundary (MAX does this which is why we hadn't seen it
before).

This change affects SWAT_INI.ASM only.
