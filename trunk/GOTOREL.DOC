Fix Bug in Goto Function

When using the goto function (Shift-F1) on a rel8 or rel16 instruction
(such as Jcc rel8), I forgot that the byte/word in the instruction is
sign-extended (not zero-extended) before it is added to the offset of
the next instruction to get the address of the target instruction.
This TWT fixes that.

This change affects SWAT_AGR.ASM only.
